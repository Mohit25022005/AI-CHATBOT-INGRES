[{"source": "INGRES_Enhanced_Reference.txt", "title": "INGRES_Enhanced_Reference.txt - chunk 0", "text": "INGRES Database System - Enhanced Reference Guide OVERVIEW INGRES is a powerful, enterprise-grade relational database management system designed for high-performance applications. It supports ANSI SQL standards and provides advanced features for scalability, security, and reliability. CONNECTION CONFIGURATION Default Connection Settings: - Default Port: 21064 - Protocol: TCP/IP - Connection String Format: [host]:[port]/[database] - Authentication Methods: Username/Password, Certificate-based, Kerberos, LDAP Connection Parameters: - vnode: Specifies the virtual node name - database: Target database name - user: Username for authentication - password: User password - group: User group identifier - role: Application role - timeout: Connection timeout in seconds (default: 30) Example Connection Strings: - Simple: localhost:21064/mydb - With authentication: user:password@host:21064/database - Secure: ssl://host:21064/database?cert=mycert.pem COMMON ERROR CODES AND SOLUTIONS E_US0845 - Connection Timeout Error Description: Connection attempt exceeded timeout limit Causes: Network latency, server overload, firewall blocking Solutions: 1. Increase connection timeout value 2. Check network connectivity with ping/telnet 3. Verify firewall rules allow port 21064 4. Monitor server resource usage 5. Check INGRES server status and logs E_US1234 - Authentication Failed Description: Invalid credentials or insufficient privileges Causes: Wrong username/password, expired account, insufficient permissions Solutions: 1. Verify username and password are correct 2. Check account status and expiration 3. Confirm user has database access privileges 4. Review group and role assignments 5. Check authentication method configuration E_US5678 - Database Not Found Description: Specified database does not exist or is inaccessible Causes: Incorrect database name, database not started, permission issues Solutions: 1. Verify database name spelling and case 2. Check if database is properly started 3. Confirm database exists using sysmod utility 4. Review user access permissions for the database 5. Check database configuration files E_US9012 - Lock Timeout Description: Transaction could not acquire required locks within timeout period Causes: Long-running transactions, high concurrency, deadlocks Solutions: 1. Increase lock timeout settings 2. Optimize transaction design for shorter duration 3. Review locking strategy and isolation levels 4. Monitor for deadlock conditions 5. Consider connection pooling to manage concurrency PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION Indexing Strategies: - Create indexes on frequently queried columns - Use composite indexes for multi-column searches - Monitor index usage with performance statistics - Regularly update index statistics for optimal query plans - Consider partial indexes for large tables with selective conditions Query Optimization: - Use EXPLAIN to analyze query execution plans - Avoid SELECT * in production queries - Use appropriate WHERE clause conditions - Leverage JOIN hints when necessary - Consider query rewriting for better performance Memory Configuration: - Buffer Pool Size: Allocate 70-80% of available RAM - Sort Memory: Size based on typical sort operations - Lock Memory: Adequate for concurrent user load - Session Memory: Per-connection memory allocation TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE Connection Issues: 1. Verify INGRES server is running (ingstart command) 2. Check listener process status 3. Test network connectivity to server 4. Review connection string parameters 5. Check client and server logs for errors 6. Validate firewall and security group settings Performance Issues: 1. Monitor system resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O) 2. Analyze slow queries using query logs 3. Check for lock contention and blocking 4. Review database statistics and maintenance 5. Consider workload distribution across multiple servers 6. Evaluate storage subsystem performance Data Integrity Issues: 1. Run database consistency checks 2. Verify transaction log integrity 3. Check for filesystem corruption 4. Review backup and recovery procedures 5. Validate data validation rules and constraints ADVANCED FEATURES High Availability: - Cluster configuration for failover support - Replication setup for data redundancy - Load balancing across multiple servers - Automatic failover mechanisms - Backup and recovery strategies Security Features: - Role-based access control (RBAC) - Column-level security policies - Encryption for data at rest and in transit - Audit logging for compliance requirements - Integration with enterprise authentication systems Monitoring and Maintenance: - Performance monitoring tools and metrics - Automated maintenance scheduling - Log rotation and archival policies - Capacity planning and growth management - Health check and alerting mechanisms INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION System Requirements: - Operating System: Linux, Unix, Windows - Minimum RAM: 4GB (8GB recommended) - Disk Space: 10GB minimum for installation - Network: TCP/IP connectivity - Privileges: Administrative access for installation Installation Steps: 1. Download INGRES installer package 2. Run installer with administrative privileges 3. Configure system parameters during setup 4. Initialize database environment 5. Create initial databases and users 6. Configure network listeners 7. Test connection and basic functionality 8. Set up monitoring and backup procedures Configuration Files: - config.dat: Main configuration parameters - symbol.tbl: System symbol definitions - protect.dat: Security and access control - startup.dat: Service startup configuration MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES Regular Maintenance Tasks: 1. Update database statistics weekly 2. Check and optimize indexes monthly 3. Review and archive log files regularly 4. Monitor disk space usage 5. Perform consistency checks 6. Test backup and recovery procedures 7. Apply security patches and updates 8. Review performance metrics"}, {"source": "INGRES_Enhanced_Reference.txt", "title": "INGRES_Enhanced_Reference.txt - chunk 1", "text": "during setup 4. Initialize database environment 5.
