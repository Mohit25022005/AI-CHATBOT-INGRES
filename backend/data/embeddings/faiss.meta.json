It supports ANSI SQL standards and provides advanced features for scalability, security, and reliability. CONNECTION CONFIGURATION Default Connection Settings: - Default Port: 21064 - Protocol: TCP/IP - Connection String Format: [host]:[port]/[database] - Authentication Methods: Username/Password, Certificate-based, Kerberos, LDAP Connection Parameters: - vnode: Specifies the virtual node name - database: Target database name - user: Username for authentication - password: User password - group: User group identifier - role: Application role - timeout: Connection timeout in seconds (default: 30) Example Connection Strings: - Simple: localhost:21064/mydb - With authentication: user:password@host:21064/database - Secure: ssl://host:21064/database?cert=mycert.pem COMMON ERROR CODES AND SOLUTIONS E_US0845 - Connection Timeout Error Description: Connection attempt exceeded timeout limit Causes: Network latency, server overload, firewall blocking Solutions: 1. Increase connection timeout value 2. Check network connectivity with ping/telnet 3. Verify firewall rules allow port 21064 4. Monitor server resource usage 5. Check INGRES server status and logs E_US1234 - Authentication Failed Description: Invalid credentials or insufficient privileges Causes: Wrong username/password, expired account, insufficient permissions Solutions: 1. Verify username and password are correct 2. Check account status and expiration 3. Confirm user has database access privileges 4. Review group and role assignments 5. Check authentication method configuration E_US5678 - Database Not Found Description: Specified database does not exist or is inaccessible Causes: Incorrect database name, database not started, permission issues Solutions: 1. Verify database name spelling and case 2. Check if database is properly started 3. Confirm database exists using sysmod utility 4. Review user access permissions for the database 5. Check database configuration files E_US9012 - Lock Timeout Description: Transaction could not acquire required locks within timeout period Causes: Long-running transactions, high concurrency, deadlocks Solutions: 1. Increase lock timeout settings 2. Optimize transaction design for shorter duration 3. Review locking strategy and isolation levels 4. Monitor for deadlock conditions 5. Consider connection pooling to manage concurrency PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION Indexing Strategies: - Create indexes on frequently queried columns - Use composite indexes for multi-column searches - Monitor index usage with performance statistics - Regularly update index statistics for optimal query plans - Consider partial indexes for large tables with selective conditions Query Optimization: - Use EXPLAIN to analyze query execution plans - Avoid SELECT * in production queries - Use appropriate WHERE clause conditions - Leverage JOIN hints when necessary - Consider query rewriting for better performance Memory Configuration: - Buffer Pool Size: Allocate 70-80% of available RAM - Sort Memory: Size based on typical sort operations - Lock Memory: Adequate for concurrent user load - Session Memory: Per-connection memory allocation TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE Connection Issues: 1. Verify INGRES server is running (ingstart command) 2. Check listener process status 3. Test network connectivity to server 4. Review connection string parameters 5. Check client and server logs for errors 6. Validate firewall and security group settings Performance Issues: 1. Monitor system resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O) 2. Analyze slow queries using query logs 3. Check for lock contention and blocking 4. Review database statistics and maintenance 5. Consider workload distribution across multiple servers 6. Evaluate storage subsystem performance Data Integrity Issues: 1. Run database consistency checks 2. Verify transaction log integrity 3. Check for filesystem corruption 4. Review backup and recovery procedures 5. Validate data validation rules and constraints ADVANCED FEATURES High Availability: - Cluster configuration for failover support - Replication setup for data redundancy - Load balancing across multiple servers - Automatic failover mechanisms - Backup and recovery strategies Security Features: - Role-based access control (RBAC) - Column-level security policies - Encryption for data at rest and in transit - Audit logging for compliance requirements - Integration with enterprise authentication systems Monitoring and Maintenance: - Performance monitoring tools and metrics - Automated maintenance scheduling - Log rotation and archival policies - Capacity planning and growth management - Health check and alerting mechanisms INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION System Requirements: - Operating System: Linux, Unix, Windows - Minimum RAM: 4GB (8GB recommended) - Disk Space: 10GB minimum for installation - Network: TCP/IP connectivity - Privileges: Administrative access for installation Installation Steps: 1. Download INGRES installer package 2. Run installer with administrative privileges 3. Configure system parameters during setup 4. Initialize database environment 5. Create initial databases and users 6. Configure network listeners 7. Test connection and basic functionality 8. Set up monitoring and backup procedures Configuration Files: - config.dat: Main configuration parameters - symbol.tbl: System symbol definitions - protect.dat: Security and access control - startup.dat: Service startup configuration MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES Regular Maintenance Tasks: 1. Update database statistics weekly 2. Check and optimize indexes monthly 3. Review and archive log files regularly 4. Monitor disk space usage 5. Perform consistency checks 6. Test backup and recovery procedures 7. Apply security patches and updates 8. Review performance metrics"

This chapter introduces various conventions and notations followed throughout the guide. Audience The System Administrator Guide is designed for the system administrator who has overall responsibility for the operation of the Ingres installation. The system administrator must have a solid working knowledge of operating system management or be in close contact with the operating system administrator. Special Considerations Before using this guide, you should be aware of the following issues. Ingres installations can be administered in compliance with the C2 security standard. If you are using an Enterprise Access product, see your Enterprise Access documentation for information about syntax that may differ from that described in this guide. Ingres is compliant with ISO Entry SQL92. In addition, numerous vendor extensions are included. For details about the settings required to operate in compliance with ISO Entry SQL92, see the SQL Reference Guide . Query Language Used in This Guide The industry standard query language, SQL, is used as the standard query language throughout this guide. QUEL commands and system parameters, such as environment variables or logicals, are also included in this guide. For a complete description of available QUEL statements, see the QUEL Reference Guide . System-specific Text in This Guide 16 System Administrator Guide System-specific Text in This Guide This guide provides information that is specific to your operating system, as in these examples: Windows: This information is specific to the Windows operation system. UNIX: This information is specific to the UNIX operation system. VMS: This information is specific to VMS operating system. When necessary for clarity, the symbol is used to indicate the end of the system-specific text. For sections that pertain to one system only, the system is indicated in the section title. Path Notation in This Guide The directory structure of an Ingres installation is the same regardless of operating system. Rather than showing path examples for all environments, this guide uses UNIX notation only. For example: When describing the location of the collation sequence file, the guide shows: $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/collation/collation_name. On Windows, the location is: %II_SYSTEM%\\ingres\\files\\collation\\collation_name On VMS, the location is: II_SYSTEM:[INGRES.FILES.COLLATION]collation_name Terminology Used in This Guide This guide uses the following terminology:  A command is an operation that you execute at the operating system level. An extended operation invoked by a command is often referred to as a utility .  A statement is an operation that you embed within a program or execute interactively from a terminal monitor. Note: A statement can be written in Ingres 4GL, a host programming language (such as C), or a database query language (SQL or QUEL). Syntax Conventions Used in This Guide Introducing Ingres System Administration 17 Syntax Conventions Used in This Guide This guide uses the following conventions to describe syntax: Convention Usage Regular fixed font Indicates key words, symbols, or punctuation that you must enter as shown Italics Represent a variable name for which you must supply an actual value [ ] (brackets) Indicate an optional item { } (braces) Indicate an optional item that you can repeat as many times as appropriate | (vertical bar) Separates items in a list and indicates that you must choose one item Understanding Ingres Components 19 Chapter 2: Understanding Ingres Components This chapter discusses the Ingres components, utilities, and tools available to the system administrator to work with Ingres. Responsibilities of a System Administrator The system administrator has all privileges and holds the primary responsibility for installing and maintaining Ingres. The system administrator (often referred to as the installation ow ner) owns the user ID specified during Ingres installation. Logging in as this user provides permissions that are needed for installation and maintenance. The system administrator has the following responsibilities:  Installing Ingres (and optional components)  Authorizing users to access Ingres  Defining Ingres variables such as II_DATABASE and II_INSTALLATION  Starting, stopping, configuring, and monitoring servers  Disconnecting or suspending a session connected to a server  Shutting down the Ingres installation (or its components) Components of an Ingres Installation 20 System Administrator Guide Components of an Ingres Installation The system administrator installs and maintains the following principal components or associated family of compatible components:  DBMS Server  Internet Communication  General Communication Facility  Querying and reporting tools  Visual tools  Logging and locking systems An Ingres installation also has:  Library files and utilities, provided with the product distribution  Configuration files and error log files, created during installation and at runtime by Ingres  Databases and their associated files: the checkpoint, journal, dump, and work files, also created by Ingres during installation and at runtime The locations of these files are selected at installation"

For the initial installation, default settings are provided by the system whenever possible. After the installation is running, all Ingres servers must be monitored to ensure that they are running and that they are configured for top performance. You can also configure selected Ingres parameters. DBMS Server Understanding Ingres Components 21 DBMS Server The Ingres client-server architecture allows multiple users access to databases through connections to one or more DBMS Server processes. The DBMS Server (iidbms) is a multi-threaded daemon process that performs asynchronous disk input/output. The number of users connected to a server is limited by hardware or the operating system. Since it is unlikely that the default DBMS server configuration suits all users' requirements, the DBMS Server is usually configured to improve performance in a particular configuration. For a selected DBMS server definition, its buffer caches can be configured as well as other parameters and derived parameters. DBMS servers can be configured to fit specific needs. For example, you can:  Designate one server to access a particular database, denying other servers access to that database.  Configure a server as a \"fast commit\" server to achieve higher levels of performance.  Specify that two or more servers share a common memory buffer cache.  Specify private buffer cache with distributed multi-cache protocol. Some elements of the DBMS Server are described as facilities. Note: Ingres preallocates most of the resources it requires. It may use hundreds of megabytes of virtual memory and allocate hundreds of thousands of handles; the use of these resources depends on the number and size of the page caches enabled. Query Processing A typical interaction with Ingres consists of at least two processes:  An Ingres tool or application  DBMS Server process The Ingres Tool or Application Process The Ingres tool or application performs the following actions:  Takes user input and issues a query that is sent to the DBMS Server.  Formats, optimizes, and executes the query on behalf of the user.  Displays the resulted data returned by the DBMS Server. DBMS Server Facilities 22 System Administrator Guide DBMS Server Process The Ingres DBMS Server is a multi-threaded process. It can execute queries for a large number of users, each running an Ingres tool. Even though it is a single process, the DBMS Server can execute queries as multiple “sessions” on behalf of multiple users. The Visual Performance Monitor tool lets you view which sessions are running in the DBMS Server at any moment. Query Environment When a thread or session executes a query inside the DBMS Server, it does so in a query environment . The query environment consists of:  A quantity of resources available from the operating system for use by the session.  The rules under which the query is executed. These rules reflect which query language is used, which locking strategy is employed, which diagnostic information is returned, which default behavior Ingres adopts for various query language statements, and so on. DBMS Server Facilities The following are DBMS Server facilities, which are configured using DBMS Server configuration parameters:  Abstract Data Type Facility  Compatibility Library Facility  Data Manipulation Facility  Optimizer Facility  Parser Facility  Query Execution Facility  Query Storage Facility  System Control Facility  Relation Description Facility  General Communication Facility DBMS Server Facilities Understanding Ingres Components 23 Abstract Data Type Facility Abstract Data Type Facility (ADF) does all the work that involves data types. It manipulates floating-point numbers, character strings, integers, and all the conversions and comparisons between them. This facility can be executed independently from the server so that other Ingres tools can also use ADF. This abstract data type facility is also compiled into the Ingres tools such as QBF (Query-By-Forms) and the Terminal Monitor. It is used to manipulate Ingres data types in the front-end process before sending them to the DBMS Server. Compatibility Library Facility Compatibility Library Facility (CLF) provides the Ingres DBMS Server with a platform independent interface to the operating system.

This abstract data type facility is also compiled into the Ingres tools such as QBF (Query-By-Forms) and the Terminal Monitor. It is used to manipulate Ingres data types in the front-end process before sending them to the DBMS Server. Compatibility Library Facility Compatibility Library Facility (CLF) provides the Ingres DBMS Server with a platform independent interface to the operating system. It contains functions that perform services such as disk I/O, memory management, Semaphore manipulation, and context switching (when Ingres threading is configured). It also provides low level system communications functions. For example, when a thread in the DBMS is idle, it normally shows up in iimonitor, IPM, or VDBA as having curr ent facility CLF. This indicates that the thread is executing a CLF function to read information from the communications channel that connects the thread to the system process that instigated the database connection associated with this thread. Data Manipulation Facility The Data Manipulation Facility (DMF) manages the DBMS Server interface to disk storage. In addition to managing all storage structures (hash, heap, ISAM, B-tree, BLOBs, and so on), DMF us es the logging and locking systems to control transaction processing and to handle concurrency issues. Included within DMF is a buffer manager that controls access to a cache (possibly shared) of database pages. Optimizer Facility The Optimizer Facility (OPF) selects the optimal plan for implementing queries. It also converts the query tree that comes out of the parser into the query execution plan (QEP). OPF uses a memory pool for its operations. DBMS Server Facilities 24 System Administrator Guide Parser Facility The Parser Facility (PSF) converts querie s from text form to internal format. The parser adds data from the system catalogs to the query, such as information about the table structure and keys that the optimizer needs to make a useful query plan. Query Execution Facility The Query Execution Facility (QEF) executes query plans and database utilities. It provides internal query services that other facilities use. QEF manages repeat queries, transactions, and cursors. Query Storage Facility The Query Storage Facility (QSF) provides shared memory facilities with a temporary or permanent place to store query trees and query plans. System Control Facility The System Control Facility (SCF) is the central controlling facility that manages sessions on behalf of user (client) requests. It coordinates the actions among the various facilities involved in processing a query, including thread monitoring and switching. SCF is also responsible for managing server-wide access to shared resources, such as operating system semaphores and memory. Relation Description Facility The Relation Description Facility (RDF) is a central caching point for information about tables. RDF is used by Ingres Distributed Option, PSF, and OPF. General Communication Facility Understanding Ingres Components 25 General Communication Facility The General Communication Facility (GCF) manages communication among all components of Ingres. GCF has five elements:  Name Server  Communications Server  Data Access Server  Bridge Server  General Communications Architecture Name Server The Name Server keeps track of all DBMS, Data Access, JDBC, Communications, Bridge, Star, Internet Communications, and Enterprise Access servers in an installation and provides user processes with the information they require to connect to local or remote installations. How the Name Server Works The Name Server provides information to user processes that enables a connection to a local DBMS Server. When a process wants to connect to a remote DBMS Server:  The Name Server provides information that allows the process to first connect to a Communications Server.  The Communications Server establishes communication with the remote DBMS Server.  The Name Server checks regularly (the default is every five minutes) to ensure that all DBMS Servers on its list are functioning. If a server has shut down, the Name Server automatically deletes its registration. Name Server Maintenance Utility The Name Server Maintenance Utility (iinamu) is a part of the General Communication Facility provided by Ingres. This utility allows the system administrator to manually add servers to or delete servers from the list maintained by the Name Server, or to stop and restart the Name Server. For more information about this utility, see the Command Reference Guide . General Communication Facility 26 System Administrator Guide Communications Server The Communications Server (iigcc) is a daemon process that provides the network communication element of the Ingres Net product. It monitors outgoing communication from local applications to remote DBMS Servers and incoming communication from remote applications to local DBMS Servers. An installation can have multiple Communications Server processes. For more information on the Communications Server, see the Connectivity Guide . Data Access Server The Data Access Server enables communication between Java applets and applications and Ingres."

An installation can have multiple Communications Server processes. For more information on the Communications Server, see the Connectivity Guide . Data Access Server The Data Access Server enables communication between Java applets and applications and Ingres. The Data Access Server is the server component of the JDBC Driver, and also provides DBMS Server access for the Ingres .NET Data Provider. Data Access Server parameters include the maximum number of inbound sessions, client connections, connection pooling, pooling timeouts, network port, listen address, and protocol status. Configuration of the Data Access Server is done at installation and rarely requires reconfiguration. Bridge Server The Ingres Bridge extension enables co mmunication between Ingres clients on one network and servers on a different type of network. Reconfiguration of the Bridge Server is rarely required. For information on the Bridge Server’s role in Ingres connectivity, see the Connectivity Guide . General Communications Architecture The General Communications Architecture (GCA) is the lowest level General Communications Facility Application Program Interface. The GCA maintains communication connections between processes on the same local Ingres installation. The GCA is a subroutine library that is a part of all Ingres tools, DBMS Servers, Star Servers, and the libraries associated with embedded SQL and EQUEL. Internet Communication Understanding Ingres Components 27 Internet Communication The Ingres Web Deployment Option provides the foundation for internet-based electronic commerce. Using this component, users can quickly and easily build Web pages with corporate data and deploy database Web applications. For more information, see the Web Deployment Option User Guide . Querying and Reporting Tools Ingres provides several querying and reporting tools such as Report-Writer, Report-By-Forms (RBF), Query-By-Forms (QBF), and Vision to enable users to access Ingres databases. When a user accesses a database through tools like Report-Writer, Report-By- Forms (RBF), Query-By-Forms (QBF), or Vision, a process is created and communication is initiated with the database through a DBMS Server. The name server, which is a part of the Ge neral Communication Facility, provides user information. For more information on Ingres querying and reporting tools, see the Character-based Querying and Reporting Tools User Guide . Visual Tools Ingres lets you start, stop, manage, and monitor the Ingres installation using various GUI tools. Visual Manager Ingres Visual Manager (IVM) provides a global view into the Ingres installation. It serves as a system console from which you can manage Ingres components and access other utilities. This utility captures events that are occurring in the system and allows them to be filtered for emphasis, based on your preferences. You can access all other Ingres visual tools through IVM. For an overview of IVM tasks, see the chapter \"Managing your System and Monitoring Performance.\" For instructions on using IVM screens, see the IVM online help. For information on IVM command line tasks, see the Command Reference Guide . Visual Tools 28 System Administrator Guide Visual Performance Monitor Visual Performance Monitor can be used as a monitoring tool, a performance analysis tool, and a system management tool. Visual Performance Monitor lets you monitor the following:  Servers You can view a list of the servers that are started on an Ingres installation, and information about each server. For example, you can view the sessions that are currently active for each server. You can also remove a session or stop a server (if you are a privileged user). Visual Performance Monitor provides the following information for a particular server: – Lock lists – Locks – Transactions – Locked databases, tables, and pages – Other locked resources – Network traffic for Net servers  Users and sessions You can monitor users for whom there are open sessions. You can find out which sessions are open for a particular user, and drill down further to reveal all the related information about those sessions (lock lists, transactions locked, databases locked, and so on).  Logging You can view logging system summaries, transaction lists, process, and database lists. Log information can be used to monitor transaction rates, log file activity, processes, and databases in the logging system. This information is useful in determining which logging parameters need to be adjusted.  Locking You can monitor lock information to help determine which lock parameters need to be adjusted. Viewing locking system summaries, lock lists, and resources provides you with the information you need to spot conditions when, for example, additional locking system resources need to be added. Viewing your lock lists is useful for locating transactions"

Viewing your lock lists is useful for locating transactions that cannot proceed because they are blocked by another transaction. Visual Tools Understanding Ingres Components 29  System performance You can view your performance information from a “database” point of view. This means you can access performance information using a database branch, as opposed to the root branches of Visual Performance Monitor.  Replication You can start, stop, and monitor Replicator servers that are required for the replication scheme that has been defined in a VDBA DOM window. You can set up startup parameters for these servers, send events to these servers, view and manage collisions, and display other miscellaneous replication monitor information. Visual Performance Monitor lets you perform the following actions:  Refresh data in the window from a server  Shut down a database server or close a session Visual DBA Visual DBA provides an alternative set of system administration tools. It allows you to perform system administrator functions including configuring, performance monitoring, backup and recovery, and remote database optimization. For an overview of Visual DBA tasks related to communications, see the Connectivity Guide . For instructions on using Visual DBA screens, see the Visual DBA online help. For information on Visual DBA command line tasks, see the Command Reference Guide Visual Tools 30 System Administrator Guide Remote Command Server Some options and dialogs in Visual DBA result in the launch of an operating system level command (such as createdb or destroydb) on the server. These \"remote commands\" are performed by the Remote Command Server (RMCMD) process on behalf of Visual DBA. The Remote Command Server (RMCMD) allows remote execution of operating system commands. It must be started in installations where a DBMS server is running for certain DBA tasks to be accessible remotely with Visual DBA. The Remote Command Server is started on the server side, not on the Visual DBA client. DBA tasks are primarily those that do not have an equivalent through an SQL statement, for example, creating or dropping a database, displaying selected portions of the journal for a database, or starting a replication server remotely. By default, only the installation owner is authorized to perform such tasks remotely through Visual DBA. The rmcmd process is started and stopped with Ingres, according to the settings for the Remote Command co mponent in CBF or Configuration Manager. Grant Access to Remote Users To allow a user other than the installation owner to execute remote commands, you can use either of the following methods:  You use the Create or Alter User dialog in VDBA. Enable the Remote Command (rmcmd) Privileges checkbox.  You can execute the following SQL statements, while connected to the imadb database as the installation owner: grant select,insert,update,delete on $ingres.remotecmdinview to user grant select,insert,update,delete on $ingres.remotecmdoutview to user grant select,insert,update,delete on $ingres.remotecmdview to user grant execute on procedure $ingres.launchremotecmd to user grant execute on procedure $ingres.sendrmcmdinput to user grant register, raise on dbevent $ingres.rmcmdcmdend to user grant register, raise on dbevent $ingres.rmcmdnewcmd to user grant register, raise on dbevent $ingres.rmcmdnewinputline to user grant register, raise on dbevent $ingres.rmcmdnewoutputline to user grant register, raise on dbevent $ingres.rmcmdstp to user Note: Grants must not be made directly to the underlying tables. Visual Tools Understanding Ingres Components 31 How Remote Commands Are Executed Operating system commands executed by the Remote Command (rmcmd) Server are executed on the server side under the user ID that launched that server (typically the installation owner). For commands that support the –u option, the rmcmd server will accept the command execution request only if it contains a –u username argument, where username is the user ID of the session through which the client application (typically VDBA) does the request. For commands that do not support the –u option, such as sysmod, alterdb, or relocatedb, the request will be accepted only if the user ID of the session is the same as the user who launched the rmcmd server on the server side.

Logging and Locking Systems Understanding Ingres Components 33 Logging and Locking Systems The logging and locking systems coor dinate the locking, recovery, and journaling of databases. The system is composed of the following components:  Lock manager  Logging facility  Recovery process  Archiver process  Log files Lock Manager The locking component controls concurrent access to a database. Shared memory is allocated to components initially during the installation procedure. The amount of shared memory that your installation requires depends on the logging and DBMS server parameters that you select during the procedure. UNIX: In UNIX, the lock manager component makes use of the shared memory segments and semaphore resources that you install when you configure the UNIX kernel. Logging Facility The logging facility implements a circular “write-ahead” transaction log file for the management of transactions within the installation. It ensures that log records are written in a way that makes them accessible to the recovery and archiver processes. Logging and Locking Systems 34 System Administrator Guide Organization of the Logging Facility The logging facility maintains in-memory log buffers. For every in-memory log buffer, there is a corresponding disk log file. Memory log buffers and disk log file blocks are the same length. The number of log buffers is configurable, set according to the performance requiremen ts of the system. The logging system manages multiple asynchronous writes of log buffers to the log file. The number of disk log file blocks corresponds to the size of the log file, and is specified when the log file is created. In a properly tuned system, most log file buffers are completely full of log records when they are written to the log file. However, as all log records associated with a transaction must be forced to the log file at certain times, principally at end transaction time, a small"

The number of disk log file blocks corresponds to the size of the log file, and is specified when the log file is created. In a properly tuned system, most log file buffers are completely full of log records when they are written to the log file. However, as all log records associated with a transaction must be forced to the log file at certain times, principally at end transaction time, a small percentage of log file blocks may contain unused space. Server group commit logic is designed to minimize the frequency of log force operations and increase log file space use. How Logging Facility Works All servers in the Ingres installation, as well as the recovery and archiver processes, share the logging facility. Lo g records written by different servers, or written by several threads in the sa me server, can be combined with log records written by other servers or thre ads. The Logging Facility performs the following actions:  Copies the Log records to in-memory log buffers, which are written to the log file as they fill.  The log file block is rewritten when the file wraps around. Recovery Process The recovery process performs recovery in the event of a server or system failure. The recovery process maintains a history of important actions in its own message log file, iircp.log. Data Manipulation Facility Recovery Process (dmfrcp) Each installation of Ingres has a dmfr cp (data manipulation facility recovery process) that is assigned recovery responsibilities. In normal circumstances, transaction commit and rollback processing are handled within each DBMS server. In the event of a server or system failure, however, the recovery process performs the required recove ry, including backing out uncommitted transactions and ensuring that committed transactions are properly reflected on disk. Logging and Locking Systems Understanding Ingres Components 35 Recovery Modes The recovery process operates in the following modes:  Online recovery  Offline recovery Online Recovery Online recovery is performed when a se rver stops abnormally. In this case, users connected to other servers are generally unaffected by the recovery. Offline Recovery Offline recovery is performed when the installation is brought back up after it has stopped abnormally. In this case, the installation remains unavailable until the recovery process completes all required recovery. Archiver Process The archiver process (dmfacp) is responsible for copying the history of operations performed on journaled databases from the transaction log file to the journal files. The archiver process maintains a history of important actions in its own message log file, iiacp.log. The archiver process removes completed transactions from the transaction log file. For journaled tables, the archiver writes any completed transaction to the journal files for the database. Each database has its own journal files, which contain a record of all the changes made to the database since the last checkpoint was taken. The archiver process “sleeps” until sufficient portions of the transaction log file are ready to be archived or until the last user exits from a database. Data Manipulation Facility Archiver Process (dmfacp) Each installation has a single archiver process called the dmfacp (data manipulation facility archiver process). The archiver process is responsible for copying the history of operations performed on journaled databases from the transaction log file to the journal files. Journal files contain the subset of transaction log file information associated with a specific database. The name of the DMFACP process depends on the installation code. For Ingres installations with installation code II, the process name is DMFACP. For installation codes other than II, the DMFACP process name is DMFACPxx where xx is the installation code. Logging and Locking Systems 36 System Administrator Guide Journal Files Journal files contain the subset of transaction log file information associated with a specific database. Journal files are created (and optionally destroyed) during a checkpoint operation. In the event of a disaster, the database can be rebuilt by restoring the latest checkpoint and applying journal file information. Disaster Recovery Command Disaster recovery operations are coordinated by the rollforwarddb command. It can be accessed through the Visual DBA Database menu, DOM window. Transactions Recovery Transaction recovery involves the transaction log file that is used as a write-ahead log, plus journal files maintained on a per-database basis. Log files contain short-term recovery information regarding active databases, while the journal files contain long-term information used for auditing and disaster recovery. While the log file is circular and wraps around, journal files are of configurable length and are retained indefinitely. Ingres employs a page-oriented recovery scheme, where changes to pages are reflected in the transaction log file. Types of Transaction Recovery Recovery information is divided into two"

While the log file is circular and wraps around, journal files are of configurable length and are retained indefinitely. Ingres employs a page-oriented recovery scheme, where changes to pages are reflected in the transaction log file. Types of Transaction Recovery Recovery information is divided into two types:  Undo (or Rollback) Operations  Redo (or Cache Restore) Operations Ingres performs both online and offlin e recovery, as described in Recovery Modes (see page 35). Undo Operation Undo or transaction backout recovery is performed by the DBMS Server. For example, when a transaction is aborted, transaction log file information is used to roll back all related updates. The DBMS Server writes the Compensation Log Records (CLRs) to record a history of the actions taken during undo operations. Logging and Locking Systems Understanding Ingres Components 37 Redo Operation A Redo recovery operation is database-o riented. Redo recovery is performed after a server or an installation fails. Its main purpose is to recover the contents of the DMF cached data pages that are lost when a fast-commit server fails. Redo recovery is performed by the recovery process. Redo recovery precedes undo recovery. Redo Operation in a Cluster Environment In a Linux cluster environment, or any other Ingres cluster environment where all nodes are active, the local recovery server performs transaction redo/undo for a failed DBMS server on its node, just like in the non-cluster case. The difference in a cluster installation is that if the recovery process (RCP) dies on one node, either because of an Ingres failure, or a general failure of the hardware, an RCP on another node will take responsibility for cleaning up transactions for the failed nodes. Ingres Log Files Ingres maintains several log files to which it writes information about the installation activities. The various log files are:  Transaction Log File  Error Log  Archiver Log  Recovery Log  VMS Cluster Service Process Log  Primary Configuration Log Files  Operational Configuration Log Files  Optional Log Files Transaction Log File Each installation has a transaction log file, and an optional dual log file. The transaction log file holds information about all open transactions and is used to recover active databases after a system failure. You have the option to change its size and number of partitions at startup. UNIX: The UNIX log file can be created as a raw partition, or as a number of raw partitions if you choose. For details, see the Getting Started guide. Logging and Locking Systems 38 System Administrator Guide Error Log The Error Log (errlog.log) file is the main log file. It is a readable text file that you can use for troubleshooting. Messages about the installation are appended to this log with the date and time at which the error occurred. This is generally the first place to look when troubleshooting a problem. The error log contains the following information:  Error messages  Warning messages  Server start up and shutdown messages The system administrator maintains the error log file. This file continues to grow until manually truncated. The installation must be shut down before truncating or removing the errlog.log file. The error log file is located at the $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/ directory. Archiver Log The archiver log (iiacp.log) contains information about the current archiver process. This file is appended to when the archiver process starts. The log contains the following information:  Archiver start up  Archiver error messages  Archiver warning messages The archiver log is located at $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/ directory. Recovery Log The recovery log (iircp.log) contains information about the current recovery process. This file is appended to when the recovery process starts. The log contains the following information:  Current logging and locking parameter values  Recovery process error messages  Recovery process warning messages  Recovery operations information Note: The recovery log must be monitored if you are unable to connect to Ingres and suspect that the DBMS Server is in recovery mode. The recovery log is located at the $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/ directory. Logging and Locking Systems Understanding Ingres Components 39 Primary Configuration Log Files Ingres maintains transcripts of various configuration operations. The primary configuration log files that Ingres uses are as follows: config.log The config.log file contains a log of the changes made with the Configuration Manager or Configur ation-By-Forms (cbf) utility. rcpconfig.log The rcpconfig.log file contains log and error information of the last time rcpconfig was run.

Logging and Locking Systems 40 System Administrator Guide Optional Log Files Ingres provides various optional log files. These log files can be used for troubleshooting purposes. Ingres provides optional log files for:  Logging messages for specific processes  Generating logs for a specific Ingres facility  Tracing logs and tracking messages at a greater level of detail Process Logs Process logs can be set up for the following processes to isolate the error messages relating to that process:  DBMS  GCC Logging and Locking Systems Understanding Ingres Components 41 Optional Log Facility Logging can be specified for a specific Ingres facility. The following optional log and trace log files can be established by setting the associated Ingres variables. DBMS Error Log File The DBMS Server error log is optionally defined as a separate file. This log file is established by setting the Ingres variable II_DBMS_LOG to a user- defined file name. Note: By default, all logged messages are sent to the errlog.log file. If you define separate error logs, all messages are sent to both that error log file and errlog.log. GCC Error Log File The GCC error log is used for installations using Ingres Net. This is in a user- defined file. This log file is established by setting the environment variable II_GCC_LOG to the full name of a file. The error logging level is specified by II_GCC_LOG_LVL. GCC Trace Log File The GCC trace log is set up for specific troubleshooting efforts. You set II_GCA_LOG to a user file name. The associated Ingres environment variable II_GCC_TRACE defines the level of tracing. Star Error Log The Star error log is optionally defined as a separate file. This log file is established by setting the Ingres variable II_STAR_LOG to a user file name. Note: All Ingres Distributed Option errors and messages are sent to errlog.log by default. For more information about these log files, see the chapter \"Setting Environment Variables and Logicals\" and the appendix \"Environment Variables and Logicals.\" Configuring Ingres 43 Chapter 3: Configuring Ingres This chapter shows how to get started using the Ingres configuration tools and describes configuration considerations for each Ingres component.

Component Configurations Configuring Ingres 45 Component Configurations The Configuration Manager allows you to set up the components installed on the system using the Configure tab, which is displayed in the left pane in Configuration Manager. Different configurations are needed for servers that perform different functions. For example, batch jobs can require a completely different DBMS server configuration than that of an online server. If so, create a DBMS server configuration called “batch” and configure it for batch processing. The Configuration Manager lets you add, delete, or rename the various configurable server components listed in Configurable Components (see page 43). For detailed steps on performing these procedures, see the following topics in the Procedures section of the Configuration Manager online help.  Adding a Server Component Configuration  Deleting a Server Component Configuration  Changing the Name of a Server Component Configuration Note: You can perform these procedures for non-default components configurations only. Note : You cannot delete configurations for the Name Server and Recovery Server. Configurable Properties for a Component Each non-default component configuration has two properties that can be changed. They are:  Startup Count  Name Startup Count The startup count for a component repres ents the number of instances to be initiated when the Ingres installation is started. For example, if you set the startup count to five for the Communications Server, five Communications Servers start at startup time. All components that have a startup count that can be edited are daemon processes (the DBMS Server, Star, GCC, and so on). You can change the startup count for any component using Configuration Manager or the Configuration-By-Forms utility. For instructions on changing startup count, see \"Changing the Startup Count\" in the Configuration Manager online help. Component Configurations 46 System Administrator Guide Name Every non-default component can be assigned a name. The name allows you to assign a specific name to a component configuration. For instructions on changing component names, see Setting Server Properties in Configuration Manager online help. Note: You can only rename non-default server components. Configuration Snapshot A configuration snapshot file contains information on the installation’s parameters including:  Configuration parameters  vnode definitions  System variables  User variables The snapshot file can be used to compare configurations changes. For example, if you encounter problems with the installation later, take another snapshot of the configuration and compare it to the earlier snapshot to determine if any configuration changes have contributed to the problem. Also, keep an on-going record of conf iguration changes by taking a snapshot of the installation each time you change its configuration. Note: Before configuring or editing the system parameters, you must use the VCDA tool to create a \"snapshot\" file of the current configuration. Configuration Parameters Ingres configuration parameters are stored in the config.dat file. Some Ingres parameters are dependent on, or derived from other Ingres parameters. Component Configurations Configuring Ingres 47 Setting Parameter and Derived Parameter Values The Parameters page in Configuration Manager lists the parameters associated with a selected component configuration. For most component configurations, you can edit the value of a parameter, restore the parameter to a value that has been saved in a configuration \"snapshot\" file, or restore the parameter to its original installation value. When you select a particular component and click on one of the parameters in the Parameters tab, the Edit Value an d Restore buttons become enabled. For instructions on editing and restoring parameter values, see Setting and Restoring Component Parameters in the Procedures section of the Configuration Manager online help. Using VCDA to Restore Configuration Parameter VCDA can be used to restore configuration parameter values saved in a snapshot file."

Viewing and Recalculating Derived Parameters By clicking the Derived tab, you can view a list of, as well as recalculate any of the derived parameters. Any derived pa rameter can be set in \"protected\" mode. This means that Configuration Manager or the Configuration-By-Forms utility cannot recalculate the derived value. This allows you to set a desired value for the parameter, even though the value is normally derived by the system from other parameters. If protected mode is disabled, the value of the parameter is adjusted whenever new va lues are set for other parameters on which the derived value is based. The new and old values are shown in the change log. For detailed steps on performing these procedures, see the following topics in Configuration Manager online help:  Recalculating Derived Parameter Values  Protecting Derived Parameters Component Configurations 48 System Administrator Guide Components That Use Derived Parameters The following components contain para meters that are derived from other parameters:  DBMS Server  Star Server  Security  Locking System  Logging System  Recovery Server When a parameter is changed, any parameters derived from that parameter are automatically updated. Derived parameters appear on the Derived tab. DBMS Server Configuration Configuring Ingres 49 DBMS Server Configuration The Ingres client-server architecture allows multiple users access to databases through connections to one or more DBMS Server processes. The DBMS Server (iidbms) is a multi-threaded daemon process that performs asynchronous disk input/output. The number of users connected to a server is limited by hardware or the operating system. Since it is unlikely that the default DBMS server configuration suits all users' requirements, the DBMS Server is usually configured to improve performance in a particular configuration. For a selected DBMS server definition, its buffer caches can be configured as well as other parameters and derived parameters. DBMS servers can be configured to fit specific needs. For example, you can:  Designate one server to access a particular database, denying other servers access to that database.  Configure a server as a \"fast commit\" server to achieve higher levels of performance.  Specify that two or more servers share a common memory buffer cache.  Specify private buffer cache with distributed multi-cache protocol. Some elements of the DBMS Server are described as facilities. Note: Ingres preallocates most of the resources it requires. It may use hundreds of megabytes of virtual memory and allocate hundreds of thousands of handles; the use of these resources depends on the number and size of the page caches enabled. For instructions on configuring DBMS server parameters, see the following topics in Configuration Manager online help:  Cache Parameters Page, DBMS Server Component  Parameters Page, DBMS Server Component  Derived Page, DBMS Server Component DBMS Server Configuration 50 System Administrator Guide Fast Commit Option The fast_commit option, which is enabled using the Derived Page of the DBMS Server Component in Configuration Manager, allows the server to execute commits without forcing data pages to the database. This reduces I/O in the server and improves response time. Without fast commit, all update transactions must do the following when a commit is executed:  Force all “log” records for this transaction to disk  Force all updated data pages to disk  Write a “commit” record to the “log” file and force it to disk This ensures that the data is committed and the data in the database has been written to disk when a system crash occurs immediately following a commit. With fast commit, a server can perform a commit by writing a commit record to the log file and forcing it to disk. The actual data pages are not written to the database disk until an optimal time to do so is reached. If necessary, the committed transactions can be recovered from the log file that was written to disk. Fast commit can greatly improve transaction response time and throughput and greatly reduce direct I/O to the database. All update transactions gain some benefit from using fast commit because control is returned to the application while database writes are processed asynchronously.

If necessary, the committed transactions can be recovered from the log file that was written to disk. Fast commit can greatly improve transaction response time and throughput and greatly reduce direct I/O to the database. All update transactions gain some benefit from using fast commit because control is returned to the application while database writes are processed asynchronously. Applications that tend to update the same group of records many times gain a big increase in throughput when using fast commit because writes to the database are delayed until many transactions have actually been committed. This allows the system to write out many updates with few I/O operations. However, using fast commit can also increase recovery times. If the system crashes, all committed transactions that have not yet had their data written to the disk must be recovered. To control this recovery time, adjust the consistency point frequency. DBMS Server Configuration Configuring Ingres 51 Write Behind Option The dmf_write_behind option, which is enabled using the Cache Parameters Page, DBMS Server Component in Configuration Manager, allocates server threads that asynchronously write modified data pages to disk. The write behind threads are controlled by the dmf_wb_start and dmf_wb_end thresholds that were defined at server startup time. (Both these thresholds can be changed using the Derived Cache Parameters Page, DBMS Server Component in Configuration Manager.) By allowing transactions to commit without waiting for data to be flushed to disk, fast commit can significantly improve response time. However, the data page caches of fast commit servers tend to become filled wi th modified pages. The write behind threads control the number of modified pages by asynchronously writing them to disk. If write behind threads are not used, a server quickly reaches its modified page limit (specified by dmf_modify_limit). When that happens, transactions begin to do synchronous writes to free up space in the cache, negating some of the benefits of using fast commit. Fo r this reason, if you configure a server with fast commit, you must also specify write behind to get the full performance benefits of fast commit. For two sessions to have concurrent access to a database using fast commit, each session must access the database through the same DBMS Server or through servers connected to a common buffer. To be connected to a common buffer, the server must use the cache_sharing parameter. When a server configured with the fast_commit option opens a database, it locks the database so that no other server (e xcept a server using the same buffer cache) can access the database. Note: You can use the dmf_write_behind option even if you are not using the fast_commit option; write behind threads can write to the database disk even if fast commit is not specified. The number of write behind threads used to configure the DBMS Server depends on the system’s I/O requirements. The number of writes per second each write behind thread can process depends on the speed of the disk drives. You must configure enough write behind threads to keep up with the expected I/O rate to the database. Generally, a good rule is to allocate a write behind thread for each disk on which the databases are stored. Adding more write behind threads than disk devices does not increase the system’s I/O throughput. A default installation allocates two write behind threads, which is sufficient for most application mixes. Data Access Server Configuration 52 System Administrator Guide Data Access Server Configuration The Data Access Server enables communication between Java applets and applications and Ingres. The Data Access Server is the server component of the JDBC Driver, and also provides DBMS Server access for the Ingres .NET Data Provider. Data Access Server parameters include the maximum number of inbound sessions, client connections, connection pooling, pooling timeouts, network port, listen address, and protocol status.

Star Server Configuration The Star Server supports Ingres Distribu ted Option. Ingres Distributed Option is a distributed extension to the DBMS Server, which allows data from multiple independent databases to be accessed as if it were contained in a single, centralized relational database. In this way, Ingres Distributed Option provides client applications with transparent access to enterprise-wide data. Star Server parameters include the number of connections supported by Star Servers, accounting data maintained, and the maximum number of tables that can be kept in the cache at one time. Distributed recovery can be disabled, meaning that the Star Servers created with this definition do not recover distributed transactions at startup time. This feature is helpful if there is a problem with the installation, but you want it to continue working while the problem is being investigated. Like the DBMS Server, configuration is usually required to provide optimal performance in a given scenario. For instructions on configuring Star Server parameters, see the Parameters Page, Star Server Component in the Configuration Manager online help. Name Server Configuration 54 System Administrator Guide Name Server Configuration The Name Server keeps track of all DBMS, Data Access, JDBC, Communications, Bridge, Star, Internet Communications, and Enterprise Access servers in an installation and provides user processes with the information they require to connect to local or remote installations. The Name Server parameters include the time interval for checking for active servers, and session limits. The Name Server rarely needs to be reconfigured. For instructions on configuring Name Server parameters, see the following topic in Configuration Manager online help:  Parameters Page, Name Server Component Recovery Server Configuration In the event of a server or system failure, the Recovery Server performs any required recovery, including backing out uncommitted transactions and ensuring that committed transactions are properly reflected on disk. The configurable Recovery Server system parameters include connection limits, consistency points, events, gather write algorithms, server name, thread count, Name Server registration and stack memory allocation.

Reconfiguration of the locking system is often required. The locking system can be configured to set the default locking level (system_lock_level) and the maximum number of locks that can be obtained per transaction (system_maxlocks). For detailed information on the locking system, see the Database Administrator Guide . For instructions on configuring the locking system parameters, see the following topic in Configuration Manager online help:  Parameters Page, Locking System Component Logging System Configuration 56 System Administrator Guide Logging System Configuration The logging system implements a circular transaction log file for the management of transactions within the installation. It ensures that log records are written in a way that makes them accessible to the Recovery Server and archiver process. All DBMS and Star Servers in the installation, as well as the archiver process share the logging system. Reconfiguration of the logging system is normally required to provide optimal performance for an installation. Configurable parameters for the transaction log files include: transfer block size, buffer count, full limit, logging memory status, location, name, and number of partitions. For instructions on configuring logging parameters, see the following topic in Configuration Manager online help:  Parameters Page, Logging System Component For a detailed explanation of the logging system, see the Database Administrator Guide . For instructions on creating and configuring a raw log file for UNIX platforms, see the Getting Started guide. Note: Before making changes to the transaction log, Ingres must be shut down using Ingres Visual Manager, Service Manager, or the ingstop command. This ensures all processes are stopped correctly and completely. Multiple Log Partition Configuration Ingres allows both the primary and dual transaction log files to exist on multiple devices (up to 16). Ingres improves logging system performance by allowing it to write to multiple disk devices and, on 32-bit file systems, allowing the total log file size to be greater than 2 GB. You can configure multiple log partitions using the log_file_parts parameter. When configuring multiple log partitions, keep the following in mind:  All log partitions must be the same size  The primary and dual transaction logs must use the same number of partitions For instructions on configuring multiple log partitions, see the following topic in Configuration Manager online help:  Parameters Page, Logging System Component Non-Configurable Components Configuring Ingres 57 Primary Transaction Log and Dual Transaction Log The Transaction Log pages display information about the primary and dual transaction logs. If the Ingres installation is running, the information on these pages is read-only. If it is not running, and no recovery is required from a system failure, these pages allow various operations to be performed on the transaction log files. These operations include editing the log file name, setting the log size per file, and adding, modifying or deleting locations for the primary and dual transaction log files. For instructions on configuring transaction log parameters, see the following topic in Configuration Manager online help:  Primary Log Page, Transaction Log Component Non-Configurable Components The following components cannot be configured.  Archiver Processes  Remote Command Server History of Configuration Changes Using the History of Changes page, you ca n view a list of all the changes to parameters that have been made by Configuration Manager or the Configuration-By-Forms (cbf) utility.

Ingres environment variables in UNIX and Windows are active only when you are using Ingres. A small subset of these environment variables can be reset by the user in the local environment. Windows Environment Variables 60 System Administrator Guide Symbol Table Most Ingres environment variables in Windows and UNIX are set in the Ingres symbol table (symbol.tbl) and are visible only with the user command ingprenv. When setting, unsetting, or changing environment variables, a backup of the symbol.tbl file, called symbol.bak, is maintained. If the original symbol.tbl file becomes corrupted, you can use the backup symbol table file to restore it. A history of updates to the symbol.tbl file is maintained in the symbol.log file. The symbol.log file contains information on the types of updates performed as well as some application information. The symbol.bak and symbol.log files are located in the II_CONFIG location or the II_ADMIN location (in the case of NFS Ingres instances). Windows Environment Variables Windows environment variables are set at the operating system level. These take effect before, during, and after In gres is invoked. II_SYSTEM and PATH are the only environment variables used directly by Ingres. These are set in the user’s environment using the following commands entered at the operating system prompt: set environment_variable =value The Windows environment variables are set using Ingres Visual Manager (IVM). For more information, see the IVM online help topic, Parameters Page, Ingres Installation branch. Alternatively, you can set Windows environment variables through the Control Panel. UNIX Environment Variables Setting Environment Variables and Logicals 61 UNIX Environment Variables UNIX environment variables are set at the UNIX operating system level. These are in effect before, during, and after Ingres is invoked. II_SYSTEM, PATH, and TERM are the only UNIX environment variables required and used directly by Ingres. These environment variables are set in each user’s environment using the following UNIX commands ente red at the operating system prompt: C Shell: setenv environment_variable value Bourne Shell: environment_variable= value ; export environment_variable The environmental variables are typically set in a user’s .login or .profile file, but can also be set in operating system startup scripts such as /etc/login. VMS Logicals VMS logicals are set in the system or group logical table and are visible with the system command, show logical/system or show logical/group. These are in effect before, during, and after Ingres is invoked. II_SYSTEM is the only VMS logical required and used directly by Ingres. This logical is defined by the system administrator using the following VMS command entered at the operating system prompt: define [/table_level] logical_name \"value\" The value assigned to the Ingres logical must be enclosed in double quotes. This definition is typically placed in the operation-system wide command procedure for defining site-specific logical names (sys$manager:sylogicals.com). Installation-Wide Environment Variables and Logicals Ingres environment variables and logicals that are defined at the Ingres system or installation-wide level affect all users in an installation. These are usually defined during the install procedure. However, the system administrator can reset some manually. Installation-Wide Environment Variables and Logicals 62 System Administrator Guide View Environment Variables in Windows and UNIX Use Ingres Visual Manager to view Ingres environment variables and to manually register and deregister them. Additionally, you can use it to override certain environment variables at the user level. To view environment variables in Ingres Visual Manager: 1. Select the Ingres Installation branch in Ingres Visual Manager. 2. Select the Parameters tab and select the System subtab (if not already selected). The Ingres parameters that are set at the installation (system) level are displayed. 3. Select the Show Unset Parameters check box. Parameters that are not currently set are displayed. If the User subtab is selected, those parameters that can be overridden at the user level are displayed. 4. Select the Extra subtab. Any extra Ingres environment variables that are added or variables whose names are dynamic are displayed. You can edit these parameters from this screen. Alternatively, to view all installation-wide environment variables from the command line, enter the following comman d at the operating system prompt: ingprenv To manually register or to remove an environment variable from the Ingres symbol table, use the ingsetenv and ingunset utilities.

Always use these commands to alter the symbol table. Never edit this file directly. A similar set of system administrator commands are available to set, print, and unset installation-wide Ingres environment variables simultaneously for all clients of an Ingres installation server. These commands are ingsetall, ingprall, and ingunsetall. Installation-Wide Environment Variables and Logicals Setting Environment Variables and Logicals 63 View Environment Variables in VMS Ingres logicals (with the exception of II_SYSTEM) are defined in II_CONFIG:config.dat during the install process. These logicals can be redefined locally using the operating system command define/job logical_name \"value.\" However, to update the logical definitions permanently, the II_CONFIG:config.dat file must be manually edited and the logical definitions modified. To facilitate user access to Ingres tools and logical definitions, add the following access commands to the users’ login.com file when you log into the system. For users, add: @II_SYSTEM:[ingres]ingusrdef.com For database administrators, add: @II_SYSTEM:[ingres]ingdbadef.com For the system administrator, add: @II_SYSTEM:[ingres]ingsysdef.com The commands in these files provide tools access to all users in a system-level installation and to all users with the appropriate group user identification code (UIC) in a group-level installation. The Ingres logicals contained in II_CONFIG:config.dat are redefined at a job level for each user when one of the above commands is executed. You can display all installation-wide Ingres logicals by typing the following command at the operating system prompt: show logical [/system|/group|/job] ii* Installation-Wide Environment Variables and Logicals 64 System Administrator Guide Example: Set the ING_EDIT Variable Windows and UNIX: To set ING_EDIT for an installation usin g Ingres Visual Mana ger, follow these steps: 1. Log in as the system administrator 2. In the Ingres Visual Manager, select the Ingres Installation branch. 3. Select the Parameters tab, and select the System subtab. The Ingres parameters that are set at the installation (system) level are displayed. Note: For variables that have a dynamic name, select the Extra tab instead of the System tab. 4. Select the Show Unset Parameters check box to display parameters that are not currently set. 5. Choose ING_EDIT from the Parameters list, and double-click in the value area. 6. Edit the value and press Enter. 7. Alternatively, click Add and scroll to choose the ING_EDIT variable. Enter the required value, and click OK. To set ING_EDIT using a system command, do the following: 1. Log in as the system administrator 2. At the operating system prompt type the following: Windows: ingsetenv ING_EDIT D:\\TOOLS\\VI.EXE UNIX: ingsetenv ING_EDIT /usr/bin/vi VMS: define [/table_level] logical_name \"value\" Note : On VMS, the value assigned to the Ingres logical must be in double quotes. Installation-Wide Environment Variables and Logicals Setting Environment Variables and Logicals 65 User-Definable Environment Variables and Logicals Some Ingres environment variables and logicals can be set or reset by individual users in their local environment using operating system commands. Those set in a user’s local environment supersede the Ingres environment variables and logicals set system-wide. UNIX: A good place to set user-defined environment variables is the user’s .login (for the C shell) or profile (for the Bourne Shell) file. VMS: Individual users can define Ingres environment variables at the job or process level with DCL commands, or they can be defined in the user’s login.com file. Example: Set an Environment Variable in the Local Environment One environment variable usually set in the user’s local environment is TERM_INGRES. It specifies the termcap definition to be used by the forms system. It can be redefined locally by entering commands at the operating system prompt as in the following example: Windows: SET TERM_INGRES=IBMPC UNIX: C Shell: setenv TERM_INGRES vt100f Bourne Shell: TERM_INGRES=vt100f export TERM_INGRES VMS: DEFINE TERM_INGRES \"VT100F\" Installation-Wide Environment Variables and Logicals 66 System Administrator Guide Display Current Value for Variables A user can display the values set in their environment with the following command entered at the operating system prompt: Windows: SET UNIX: BSD: printenv System V: env Installation-Wide Environment Variables and Logicals Setting Environment Variables and Logicals 67 Locally Resettable Environment Variables and Logicals In general, only the following Ingres environment variables and logicals must be set in your local environment: Windows:  II_SYSTEM  PATH UNIX:  II_SYSTEM  PATH VMS: II_SYSTEM The following Ingres environment variables and logicals can be reset by users in their local operating system shell:"

Customization of Query Runtime Environment 70 System Administrator Guide Customization of Query Runtime Environment Most aspects of the environment in which queries execute can be customized at runtime for a particular session. This can be done by executing one or more set statements to customize the environment before query execution begins. Here are some examples:  Reduce lock conflicts when running read-only queries, as for reports: set lockmode session where readlock=nolock  Display the text of the query as it is executed: set printqry Ingres makes customization flexible by permitting most components of the query environment to be set by means of set statements at the startup of individual queries (sessions). This ca n be done by using various Ingres environment variables and logicals and startup files that permit users to control both the target and duration of set statement customization. A full list of set statements can be found in your query language reference guide. Customization of Query Runtime Environment Setting Environment Variables and Logicals 71 Syntax Rules for Startup Files and Environment Variables Keep the following general syntax rules in mind while setting up startup files and environment variables:  Set statements in startup files cannot contain more than one set statement per line. Each statement must be on a line by itself.  Set statements that are read from a fi le, but executed only by the single- line terminal monitors, must be terminated with “\\g”.  Set statements defined directly inside Ingres environment variables and logicals (not written in a file) never contain the string “\\g”.  Set statements defined directly inside Ingres environment variables and logicals (not written in a file) can contain multiple set statements separated by a semicolon up to a total length of 64 characters.  The terminal monitor dayfile cannot contain set statements.

When Not to Change Installation Locations Before changing an existing Ingres in stallation location, be sure that the change is really necessary: ask yourself what needs to be moved, and why. Installation locations do not need to be changed if:  The installation needs space for future growth.  Existing databases are outgrowing their present disk partitions. Allocation of Space for Future Growth Ingres provides the capability of creating new locations and placing any new databases, tables, or indexes in these new locations. If the requirement is space for new tables or databases, you do not need to change existing locations. Instead, create the necessary new locations for these future tables and databases and use the available location flags of createdb (-d, -c, -j, -b, and - w) to create the data, checkpoint, journal, dump, and work files for the newly created database in some other location. For more information on creating new databases, see the createdb command in the Command Reference Guide . Installation Locations 88 System Administrator Guide Allocation of Additional Space for Existing Tables If space is becoming limited on a disk partition containing a particularly large table, you can move the table to a new disk or partition. Use the modify command to relocate and modify to reorganize statements as described in the Database Administrator Guide. Location Variables that Do and Do Not Require Unloading (UNIX and Windows) When you need to change the value of an installation location variable, the procedure depends to some extent on the underlying operating system. On UNIX and Windows, the procedure also depends on whether the change requires unloading the database. You can change the ING_ABFDIR location value without unloading the installation. The values of the following locations are stored in the configuration file “aaaaaaaa.cnf” of each database at the time it is created and can only be changed by unloading each database, re-installing Ingres and reloading the databases (thus creating a new configuration file):  II_SYSTEM  II_DATABASE  II_CHECKPOINT  II_JOURNAL  II_DUMP  II_WORK Change the Value of the ING_ABFDIR Variable (UNIX and Windows) To change the installation default for ING_ABFDIR: 1.

Installation Locations Setting Environment Variables and Logicals 91 Use of Symbolic Links (UNIX) Ingres does not support or recommend the use of symbolic links to change locations in UNIX. (This is possible with the UNIX ln command, which allows the UNIX system administrator to create symbolic links to new directories so that files are found in another directory even though the values of Ingres installation location variables remain unchanged.) The following are some common problems that arise from the misuse of symbolic links:  Any files to which Ingres writes must reside on a file system that is local to the machine on which the writing process is running. This is necessary because of the operating system’s inability to guarantee network writes. If symbolic links are used, writable directories can mistakenly be mounted from remote machines. This can cause write errors and data corruption.  Occasionally Ingres executables reside on NFS file systems that have been exported with the - nosuid option.

Customizing Ingres 93 Chapter 5: Customizing Ingres This chapter describes how to implement the following customization options that are available in Ingres:  Changing the character set or collation sequence  Customizing the Archiver Exit Script Ingres Character Sets Ingres supports read-in character sets. This feature allows you to use a character set other than the default character set at your installation. For example, in Thailand, the standard character set is Thai TIS. If you specify the THAI character set during the installation procedure, users at your installation will save and retrieve data using this character set. The installation utility prompts you with a list of currently supported character sets for your platform. It sets the environment variable or logical for II_CHARSETxx to the value you have sele cted, unless the default character set is chosen. If the default character set is chosen, II_CHARSETxx is not set. Important! Choose your character set carefully. An installation can use only one character set. Do not change the character set because data in existing databases can be corrupted. After running the install program, check the value of II_CHARSETxx. If II_CHARSETxx is set incorrectly, you must run the installation program again. For a complete list of supported character sets, see the Getting Started guide. For a list of the character sets available on your platform, see the online list selection during installation. Local Collation Sequences 94 System Administrator Guide Default Character Sets The default character sets are as follows: Windows: WIN1252 UNIX: ISO-8859/1 VMS: DEC Multinational DEC Multinational and ISO-8859/1 are extended ASCII character sets. They have identical definitions for the 128 7-bi t characters. They differ only in the defaults they assign for several of the 128 additional characters in the 8-bit character set. Local Collation Sequences A collation sequence determines the sorting order of any given character set. For example, in English, the order of the alphabet is most commonly used to order a list of English words. That is, words beginning with the letter c appear before words beginning with the letter d, which appear before words beginning with the letter e and so on. A collation sequence is associated with each database when the database is created. This sequence determines in wh at order sorted data is returned to users and applications, what is returned when queries use pattern matching and, in some instances, how data is stored internally. Supported Collation Sequences In a computer, if no other collation sequence is enforced, the sequence derived from the machine’s native character set, either ASCII or EBCDIC is used. The sorting order of these character sets derives from the internal numeric representation of each character. In addition to the sequences derived fr om ASCII and EBCDIC, Ingres supports two other local collation sequences. They are:  Multi, a sequence derived from the DEC Multinational Character Set  Spanish, a sequence derived from the Spanish language. If none of these sequences adequately f ills your needs, you can write your own local collation sequence. Local Collation Sequences Customizing Ingres 95 MultiCollation Sequence The multi collation sequence is based on the DEC Multinational Character Set. This character set adds several vowels with diacritical marks to the standard 7-bit ASCII character set. Following are the comparison sequences for the multi sequence that differ from those of ASCII: A < À < Á < Â < Ã < Ä < B C < Ç < D < E < È < É < Ê < Ë I < Ì < Í < Î < Ï < J N < Ñ < O O < Ò < Ó < Ô < Õ < Ö < Œ < P U < Ù < Ú < Û < Ü < V Y < Ÿ < Z < Æ< Ø < Å a < à < á < â < ã < ä < b c < ç < d < e < è < é < ê < ë i < ì < í < î < ï < j n < ñ < o o < ò < ó < ô < õ <"

Ingres allows you to write a collation sequence that has any of the following characteristics:  Character skipping—one or more specified characters are ignored for collation  One-to-one mapping—a character can be substituted for another or weighted differently for collation  Many-to-one mapping—groups of characters can be substituted for a single character or weight value for collation  Many-to-many mapping—groups of characters can be substituted for a sequence of characters or weight values for collation Guidelines for Creating a Custom Collation File Keep the following points in mind as you design and test your custom collation file:  Never create a production database with an untested collation sequence. Always test your collation file on a sample database. Each time that you modify the collation sequence to correct any bugs, you must unload the database, destroy the old database, install the new sequence, create a database with the new sequence, and reload the database.  Some collation sequences allow two strings that are different to compare as equal. These sequences are called information loss sequences. An example of this type of sequence is a sequence that ignores case. Problems that can result from such a sequence are:  If duplicates are not allowed, the DBMS drops all but one string.  If duplicates are not allowed, the DBMS does not allow you to add a row to a table if it appears to match an existing row.  The hash storage structure cannot detect when two equal but different strings are placed in a hashed relation. "

Because of these problems, we suggest that you do not use information loss sequences and the hash storage structure together. Local Collation Sequences 98 System Administrator Guide How You Write a Customize Collation Sequence To create a customized collation sequence, follow these steps: 1. Write a description file. 2. Run the description file through the aducompile utility. 3. Test your collation sequence with a small sample database. Description File—Describe Collation Sequence To define a custom collation sequence you must create a description file, which consists of a list of “instructions” that, taken as a whole, describe the collation sequence. Each instruction must appear on a separate line in the file. The format of each instruction is: value :string where: value Determines the numerical weight assigned to string. (The internal numerical weight of each character determines where a character appears in the sort order.) The value can have any of the following formats: char+number Instructs sorting of the specified string after the specified character and before the next higher-weighte d character in the character set. For example, in the following instruction, string1 is mapped as a single character that is ordered immediately after the letter H and before I in a sorted sequence: H+1:string1 In the following instruction, string2 sorts after string1 and before the letter I. H+2:string2 Local Collation Sequences Customizing Ingres 99 You can specify H+1: string or Hz+1: string and both sorts in the same manner, that is, after H and before I. However, the two examples do not behave the same when pattern matching is applied. To illustrate using an example from the Spanish language, the following instruction maps CH as a single character that exists between C and D: C+1:CH If you ask for a pattern match using the format C%, instances of CH are not returned. The alternative, Cz+1:CH, maps CH into two characters, C and a virtual character just after z. This causes CH to match as two characters. A pattern match using the format C% finds the instances of CH. charstring Sorts the specified string as the equivalent of the specified charstring. For example, in the following instruction, the word tax sorts as if it were the word revenue: revenue:tax +number Gives the specified string the internal numerical weight specified by given number. The number must be between 0 and 32766. The weighting of a character in this manner is less portable than giving the character a relative weight. +* Causes the specified string to be ignored when collation is performed. For example, in the following instru ction, the “?”is ignored whenever collation takes place. +*:? (empty) When no value is specified (the instruction takes the form: string), the collation compiler ignores the instruction. Use this format to insert comments into your collation sequence. For example: :This is a comment string Is any character or character string. An empty string causes a syntax error. Archiver Exit Script (acpexit) 100 System Administrator Guide The aducompile Utility The aducompile utility compiles your description file into a binary file and installs that file as a collation sequence that can be used. You must be the installation owner to use this utility. Be sure to give your resulting collation file a unique name so that you do not overwrite any existing collation files. Your new collation sequence is located at $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/collation/ collation_name. Note : In UNIX, all system users must have rights to read the new collation file. Archiver Exit Script (acpexit) The Archiver Process Exit command script is executed by the archiver before an error halt. This shell script (acpexit in UNIX or ACPEXIT.COM in VMS) resides in the utility directory. You can use the default script behavior, which sends mail to the installation owner account with the reason for the archiver failure, or, the script allows you to customize certain aspects of archiver recovery. Because the archiver writes sequentially to the end of journal files, a common problem occurs when the archiver stops as a result of running out of journal disk space.

Because the archiver writes sequentially to the end of journal files, a common problem occurs when the archiver stops as a result of running out of journal disk space. If left unresolved, running an installation without an archiver (and with journaled databases) eventually causes the log file to fill. To address this concern, whenever the archiver detects an error condition that forces it to stop (including running out of journal disk space) it first executes the archiver exit script. Archiver Exit Script (acpexit) Customizing Ingres 101 Customization of Archiver Exit Script You can modify the archiver exit script to take action appropriate to your installation. For example, one possible cour se of action is to delete a reserved file on the journal disk to free up space and restart the archiver. You can customize the archiver exit script in these respects:  The default script sends mail to the installation owner account when archive processing halts, and includes the reason for the failure. You can modify this script to notify the system administrator directly of a situation that needs resolving.  You can tailor the script to handle certain resource and environmental problems automatically. For example, if archive processing has stopped because of insufficient disk space, the script can automatically reclaim disk space and resume archive processing.  The default script is executed with one or two arguments, described in Archiver Exit Script Parameters (see page 101). You can choose whether to incorporate these arguments if you customize the script. The default script includes examples of processing you can use for your installation. These examples are formatted as comments, and can be included in the script by removing the comment prefixes. The script is located at $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/acpexit. Archiver Exit Script Parameters The archiver exit script parameters are as follows: Parameter Description Status errornumber An error number that describes the reason archive processing has stopped. At the end of the default script is a list of all possible error numbers, with an explanation of the error and, in many cases, the recommended actions to correct the error. Always passed in default script. database_name The name of the database that was being processed at the time archiving stopped. The name is provided only if the halt in archive processing was associated with a particular database problem, as opposed to a general system problem. Sometimes passed in default script. How You Use a Custom Mapping File for Unicode Coercion 102 System Administrator Guide How You Use a Custom Mapping F ile for Unicode Coercion The DBMS Server carries out the coercion of Unicode data to local character set value based on the Unicode converter (or mapping table). Ingres automatically chooses the converter to use, based on the encoding used by the locale on your system. You can create a custom mapping table for coercing Unicode data to local character set value if, for example, you want to map a particular character to a different Unicode code point, or create a completely new mapping table for an encoding not yet supported by Ingres. Always use the custom mapping table for your encoding once you have implemented it. Always create a new mapping file. If you wish to modify an originally supplied mapping table for an encoding do not modify the original mapping files but copy it to a new file name. To avoid data corruption, test your mapping before implementing in a production installation. If you are using a custom converter (mapping table) for an encoding, make sure that you always use the same converter for that encoding. The process for creating and using a cu stom mapping file is as follows: 1. Create a custom mapping file in XML format. This format should conform to ch aractermapping.dtd present in the directory $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/ucharm aps. This directory also contains other converters, which may serve as examples of xml file format. For more information on the xml file format, see http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr22/. 2. Compile this mapping file using unimapcompile utility, as follows: unimapcompile -o= yourmapfilename yourmapfilename .xml 3. Set the mapping file in the symbol table for the server using the ingsetenv command, as follows: ingsetenv II_UNICODE_CONVERTER yourmapfilename To check that the value is set correctly, run: ingprenv II_UNICODE_CONVERTER 4. If you have remote clients connecting to this server and will be using the encoding for which you have created the custom mapping table, then copy the compiled mapping file to all clients in the directory"

Troubleshooting Ingres 103 Chapter 6: Troubleshooting Ingres This chapter describes procedures and techniques for troubleshooting the Ingres installations. Using these procedures will help you to solve the problems yourself, or, to accurately define the problem if it is still necessary to call technical support. Process of Troubleshooting Troubleshooting is a process of defining and correcting a problem that occurs in an otherwise functioning Ingres installation and includes narrowing down the problem to a well-defined point, identifying the cause of failure, and eliminating it. When troubleshooting, you: 1. Determine the nature of the problem 2. Isolate the problem to a defined area 3. Eliminate the cause, using the following techniques:  Correcting user errors  Changing the Ingres installation environment  Changing the user environment  Changing the operating system environment  Changing the system configuration  Restarting the system if needed Troubleshooting Tools VDBA provides a set of system administration tools. It allows you to perform system administrator functions—including configuring, performance monitoring, backup and recovery, and re mote database optimization—using a GUI interface. For instructions on performing these functions, see the VDBA online help. Command line instructions are also available. For information on Ingres commands, see the Command Reference Guide. Determine the Problem Area 104 System Administrator Guide Determine the Problem Area The first step in the process of troubleshooting is to determine the problem area. The following troubleshooting flow chart shows the major problem categories: Error Log Files The error log files are located in the directory indicated by the Ingres environment variable/logical II_CONFIG. The log files are as follows: errlog.log The main DBMS error log and the default log for most programs. iiacp.log Archiver error log. iircp.log Recovery error log. Note: If your system is configured for In gres Cluster Solution, each node in the Ingres cluster maintains a separate Archiver and Recovery error log. Each log is distinguished by having _nodename appended to the base log name, where nodename is the Ingres node name for the host machine as returned by iipmhost. On VMS, if SCSNODE is set, the lo g files except errlog.log is named *.LOG_ nodename . Determine the Problem Area Troubleshooting Ingres 105 Optional Error Log Files The names of optional log files can vary, but all log files end with the extension LOG. Optional log files include: II_DBMS_LOG DBMS error log II_GCCxx_LOG GCC error log II_GC_LOG GCC trace log II_STAR_LOG Star error log Display Value for II_CONFIG To display the value for II_CONFIG, type the following command at the operating system prompt: Windows: ingprenv UNIX: ingprenv VMS: set def II_SYSTEM:[INGRES.FILES] or set def II_CONFIG. Determine the Problem Area 106 System Administrator Guide View List of Log Files For a list of log files, type the following command at the operating system prompt from the directory indicated by $II_CONFIG (UNIX) or II_CONFIG (VMS): Windows: dir *.log UNIX: ls *.log VMS: dir *.log Check the Error Log Files Checking for error logs is the first step for determining the nature of the problem. To check for error logs, follow these steps: 1. Check the log files for error messages. Examine errlog.log first. 2. If indicated, check optional log files for error messages. 3. Identify the errors associated with your problem. All errors are time stamped. Find the most recent error message associated with your problem. Read back up the log file from there to the first error relating to that problem. Many error messages cascade from that initial error. This initial error is usually the most important in identifying the problem even though it is not the error that users report. For example, the following error message merely notifies you that a DBMS server has exited for one of many possible reasons: E_SC0221_SERVER_ERROR_MAX You must look in the errlog.log for associated DBMS server errors such as “E_DM9300_DM0P_CLOSE_PAGE Buffer st ill fixed,” a fatal error message. Search the error log for additional errors occurring around the time of the error that was displayed.

Determine the Problem Area Troubleshooting Ingres 107 Find Your Problem Category To find the problem category, follow these steps: 1. Determine the general category in which your problem lies. The following categories relating to running the Ingres installation are described in this guide:  Ingres startup and shutdown  Ingres configuration  Ingres tools startup  Inconsistent database or recovery  Operating system performance For a description of problems relating to queries and performance, see the Database Administrator Guide. 2. Use the information in the error logs to determine which category to check. Error messages always include the first two letters of the facility code that generated the error. Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems 108 System Administrator Guide Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems Use the following flow chart to isolate a problem with startup, shutdown or configuration of your Ingres installation: Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems Troubleshooting Ingres 109 Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems 110 System Administrator Guide Check Ingres Installation on Windows To check if the Ingres installation is working fine, follow these steps: 1. Check that you are logged in as the installation owner. If not, log off and log in again as this user. 2. Check that all users have II_SYSTEM set by issuing the following command at the operating system prompt: echo %II_SYSTEM% All users must have Ingres executables in their path variables. Check that everyone has the full search path to %II_SYSTEM%\\ingres\\bin. The installation owner must also include %II_SYSTEM%\\ingres\\utility. 3. Check that each of the Ingres variables has a valid value. Ingres environment variables are only used and “seen” by Ingres and can be displayed with the following comma nd entered at the operating system prompt: ingprenv If you are in doubt about the function or legal value of a particular environment variable, see the chapter \"Setting Environment Variables and Logicals\" and the appendix \"Environment Variables and Logicals.\" Ingres environment variables denoting installation locations (II_DATABASE, II_CHECKPOINT, II_ DUMP, II_JOURNAL, II_LOG_FILE, II_SYSTEM) cannot be reset. To change these, you must unload the databases, rerun the installation program, and reload the databases, as described in Installation Location (see page 87). 4. Check the Ingres environment variables that have been set locally, overriding the Ingres installation-level definitions. Only a small category of Ingres environment variables must be defined in the local user environment: those that permit you to access Ingres, and those that define values that are different for your local environment. They include TERM_INGRES and ING_EDIT. If you trace the problem to an Ingres environment variable setting, correct the value. For procedures and scenarios for setting these environment variables, see the chapter \"Setting Environment Variables and Logicals.\" If the installation does not start up, continue with this procedure. 5. Check that all Ingres processes are shut down. If there are processes that continue to run, see the section Check Shutdown Problems on Windows (see page 122). 6. Restart Ingres. Attempt once again to start up the installation by issuing the following command at the operating system prompt: ingstart Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems Troubleshooting Ingres 111 If startup problems persist, continue diagnostics in the ingstart section below. Detect Ingres Startup Problems on Windows To troubleshoot startup problems on Windows, follow these steps: 1. Determine which Ingres processes are running. 2.

Identify your installation code. If there is more than one Ingres installation on this machine, type the followin g command at the operating system prompt. The installation code is used to distinguish which processes belong to which installation at sites with more than one Ingres installation on the same machine: ingprenv | grep II_INSTALLATION The two-letter installation code is displayed (for example, the following code R6): II_INSTALLATION=R6 Take note of your installation code: ______. 6. Check that all Ingres processes are shut down. If there are processes that continue to run, see Check Shutdown Problems on UNIX (see page 124). 7. Restart Ingres: Attempt once again to start up the installation by issuing the following command at the operating system prompt: ingstart 8. If startup problems persist, continue the diagnostics described in Ingbuild on UNIX (see page 114) or Detect Ingres Startup Problems on UNIX (see page 115). Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems 114 System Administrator Guide Ingbuild on UNIX The executable script ingbuild performs all the steps necessary to set up an installation. It checks system resources, installs shared memory and semaphores, configures DBMS server parameters, configures the logging and locking system, and starts all the required processes. The ingbuild program is located in $II_SYSTEM/ingres/utility. It makes use of numerous shell commands as well as the following Ingres binary and shell executables:  createdb  iilink  ingstop  ingstart  ingprenv  ingunset  sql One of the last things ingbuild does is call the ingstart script to actually start installation processes. When ingstart is called, it displays the message “Starting the Name Server process (iigcn).” If there are startup problems after this message has displayed, see Ingstart on UNIX (see page 115). Before you can diagnose a problem with ingbuild, you must identify which subroutine is failing. If you know which routine is failing and it is ingstart or one of the main installation processes (iigcn, iigcc, II_IUSV_nnn, dmfacp or iidbms), see the section below that addresses that executable.

Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems Troubleshooting Ingres 115 Detect Ingres Startup Problems on UNIX To diagnose Ingres problems, use the following procedure. 1. Display which processes are running by using the csreport and operating system ps commands. The csreport utility is described in Operating System Utilities (see page 185) and the ps command is described in UNIX Operating System Utilities (see page 187). 2. Verify that all required Ingres system processes are running. The following processes (in the order they are started) are the minimum required for a complete installation: iigcn Name Server process iigcc Communications Server process (present only on sites with Ingres Net) iidbms (II_IUSV_nnn) Recovery Server process iigcd Data Access Server process dmfacp Archiver process iidbms DBMS Server process iislave DBMS Server asynchronous write daemons—these processes are created at the time of the first database write operation (only present on sites where Ingres does not use OS threads or asynchronous I/O) iistar Distributed Database Server process (present only on sites with Ingres Distributed Option) icesvr ICE Server process iigcb Bridge Server process (present only on sites with Ingres Bridge) Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems 116 System Administrator Guide Note : If the command ingprenv | grep II_CLIENT shows “II_CLIENT = true”, you need to run only the Name Server and Communications Server processes. In a few special cases Ingres can be run without the Communications Server process. This includes releases that use the streams device driver for interprocess communications. If you are not sure if your release uses the streams device driver, see your Readme file. 3. If ingstart does not complete successfully, try to identify the reason for startup failure. For example: The problem is with ingstart. The ingstart script fails due to results of the checks it makes for sufficient resources and installation settings. If this is the reason for startup failure, correct the deficiency. A process failed to start. If a process failed to start, continue on to the details sections on startup problems for that specific process. Check Ingres Installation on VMS It is recommended that you first make the following basic installation checks: 1. Check that you are logged in as the ingres system administrator (ISA) user by issuing the following command at the operating system prompt: show process If the ISA is not shown, log off and log in again as the ISA. The ISA is typically ingres if there is only a single installation per machine. For multiple installations, there is a different ISA for each installation. 2. Check that all users have II_SYSTEM set by issuing the following command at the operating system prompt: show logical II_SYSTEM 3. Check that each of the Ingres installation logicals has a valid value. Ingres symbols are defined in the following files:  II_SYSTEM:[INGRES.UTILITY]INGSYSDEF.COM - Defines Ingres system administration, DBA, and user symbols.  II_SYSTEM:[INGRES.UTILITY]INGDBAD EF.COM - Defines Ingres DBA and user symbols.  II_SYSTEM:[INGRES.UTILITY]INGUSRD EF.COM - Defines Ingres user symbols. If you are in doubt about the function or legal value of a particular logical, see the chapter \"Setting Environment Variables and Logicals\" and the appendix “Environment Variables and Logicals”. Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems Troubleshooting Ingres 117 Ingres logicals denoting installation locations (II_DATABASE, II_CHECKPOINT, II_DUMP, II_JOURNA L, II_LOG_FILE, II_SYSTEM) can not be reset. To change these, you must edit II_CONFIG:config.dat, update the existing definition, and execute @ii_system:[ingres]ingsysdef.com. For additional details, see Installation Locations (see page 87). 4. Check the Ingres logicals that have been set locally, overriding the Ingres installation-level definitions. Issue the following command at the operating system prompt: show logical *II*, *ING* This shows which ones have been set at process, job, or group level, overriding the system-level definitions. Only a small category of Ingres logicals are defined in the local user environment: those that permit you to access Ingres, and those that define values that are different for your local environment. They can include TERM_INGRES and ING_EDIT. If you trace the problem to an Ingres logical setting, correct the value.

Attempt once again to start up the installation by issuing the following command at the operating system prompt: ingstart 8. If startup problems persist, continue diagnostics contained in the next section—vmsinstal or ingstart. Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems 118 System Administrator Guide VMSINSTAL on VMS The executable script vmsinstal performs all the steps necessary to set up an installation. It checks system resources, installs shared images, configures DBMS server parameters, configures the logging and locking system, and starts all the required processes. During the execution of the vmsinstal script, if a problem occurs, do the following: 1. Execute the vmsinstal program with the L option to log the contents of the VMSINSTAL session: @sys$update:vmsinstal * device_name options L 2. Examine the DCL by issuing the following command at the operating system prompt: set verify 3. Examine the vmsinstal log for error notifications and attempt to resolve the problem. 4. If the Installation Verification Proc edure (IVP) for the DBMS Server fails with the message “ii.node_name.syscheck.gblpages not found in config.dat” after you enter the number of concurrent users that the installation supports, check the value of the account parameter PRCLM (process limit) to ensure that it is not zero. The PRCLM must be a minimum of 15. 5. If the problem persists, contact technical support, as described in What You Need Before Contacting Technical Support (see page 179). Detect Ingres Startup Problems on VMS If you are having ingstart problems, use the following procedure: 1. Display the processes that are running by issuing the following command at the operating system prompt: show system /out = filename search filename \"II_\", \"DMF\" The search command searches the user-specified filename for the process names. 2. Verify that all required Ingres system processes are running. The following processes (in the order they are started) are the minimum required for a complete installation:  II_IUSV_ nn_ppp—Recovery process  DMFACP_ nn—Archiver process Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems Troubleshooting Ingres 119  II_GCN_ nn—Name Server process  II_GCC_ nn_pppp—Communications Server process (present only on sites with Ingres Net)  II_DBMS_ nn_pppp—DBMS Server process  II_STAR_ nn_pppp—Distributed Database Server process (present only on sites with Ingres Distributed Option)  RMCMD_ nn_ppp—Remote Command Server for use with VDBA  II_GCB_ nn_pppp—Bridge Server process (present only on sites with Ingres Bridge) Where nn is the optional two-letter installation code, and pppp is the lower two bytes of the process’ process ID. Note: If you are checking the processes on a client node, only the Name Server and Communications Server processes are displayed when issuing the $ SHOW SYSTEM command. 3. If ingstart does not complete successfully, do the following: a. Check for error messages in the errlog.log: II_SYSTEM:[INGRES.FILES] II_CONFIG:errlog.log For a complete list of error log files and individual component log files, see Logging and Locking Systems (see page 33). b.

Check that the password specified for the “Ingres Intelligent Database” service matches the installation owner user password. 3. Start the service manually. 4. If the service fails to start, run ingstart from the command prompt. 5. If the installation still does not start, contact technical support, as described in What You Need Before Contacting Technical Support (see page 179). Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems 120 System Administrator Guide Detect Ingres Startup Problems on System Reboot (UNIX) To detect Ingres startup problems on system reboot on UNIX, follow these steps: 1. The most common cause of startup failure following a reboot is failure to include the startup command ingstart in the boot script for your machine. (The boot file is vendor-specific but can be named “/etc/rc” or “etc/rc.local”.) This file contains the commands that are to be executed immediately after a reboot. Make sure that the following line appears in the boot script: su userid -c \"ii_system/ingres/utility/ingstart ii_system\" /dev/console where: userid refers to the user that owns the installation ii_system refers to the value of II_SYSTEM for your installation. 2. Make sure that /dev/kmem is readable to the user that owns the installation. If this is a security problem for your machine, you can add this user as a member of /dev/kmem’s group and make the /dev/kmem group readable. Issue the following command at the operating system prompt: chmod g+w /dev/kmem The user that owns the installation must be able to read /dev/kmem or the kernel resource checks in ingstart fails. 3. Run ingstart. If the installation still does not start, contact technical support, as described in What You Need Before Contacting Technical Support (see page 179). Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems Troubleshooting Ingres 121 Detect Ingres Startup Problems on System Reboot (VMS) To detect Ingres startup problems on system reboot on VMS, follow these steps: 1. Make sure that a real error has occurred. If Ingres is performing startup recovery, see Automatic Recovery (see page 157). 2. Check to see that the Ingres initialization code is called from the VMS startup files. There are two main startup files:  SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM SYLOGIN.COM is run when any user logs in. The script to set up Ingres user symbols are defined here. @II_SYSTEM:[INGRES]ingusrdef.com If the DBA symbols are also to be known by all users, the ingdbadef.com script can be used instead. If the system administrator symbols are also to be known by all users, the ingsysdef.com script can be used instead. Only one script needs to be defined. An alternative method is to include these in a user’s particular login.com.  SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM is run when the system is booted. To have Ingres restarted automatically on reboot, add the following line: @SYS$STARTUP:INGRES_STARTUP.COM Edit the file SYS$STARTUP:INGRES_STARTUP.COM to ensure it is correct for your environment. A line is added to start each installation, but the line is commented out to prevent accidental errors. Edit this file to meet your needs. 3. Be sure that you have examined all of the log files. Look in these files for possible error messages:  II_CONFIG:ERRLOG.LOG  II_CONFIG:IIACP.LOG (with _ nodename name suffix if configured for clusters)  II_CONFIG:IIRCP.LOG (with _ nodename name suffix if configured for clusters)  II_CONFIG:II_CSP.LOG_ nodename (cluster installations only) Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems 122 System Administrator Guide 4. Determine if any system logicals have been changed interactively since the last startup of Ingres but the command files have not been updated (use commands such as define/system/exec). Logical names become undefined when VMS is shut down and must be redefined (using the command files) at each boot. 5. Make sure that DECnet and/or TCP/IP is started before either Ingres Cluster Option or Ingres Net is started. 6. Execute the ingstart utility to start up Ingres. If the installation still does not start, contact technical support, as described in What You Need Before Con (see page 179)tacting Technical Support. Check Shutdown Problems on Windows If Ingres has problems during shutdo wn on Windows, follow these steps: 1. Check environment variables in the local user environment by entering the following commands at the operating system prompt: a. Verify that II_SYSTEM is set correctly. echo %II_SYSTEM% b.

Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems Troubleshooting Ingres 123 3. Shut down the installation by typing the following command: ingstop You can also click the Stop toolbar button in Ingres Visual Manager to shut down the installation. Note: All users must be logged out of Ingres (that is, no sessions running in the server) for ingstop to succeed. 4. Check that all processes are shut down. If shutdown succeeds, none of the following processes are running on your machine:  iigcn  iigcc  II_IUSV_ nnn  dmfacp  iidbms  iijdbc  iigcd  iistar  icesvr  iigcb  rmcmd 5. Use one of your operating system utilities to kill any of these processes that are still running. 6. Remove any shared memory segments that remain allocated to this installation. Execute the following command at the operating system prompt: ipclean Your installation is now shut down. Note : For information about shutting down an Ingres installation that includes an ICE Server, see the chapter “Managing and Monitoring Web Deployment Option” in the Web Deployment Option User Guide . Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems 124 System Administrator Guide Check Shutdown Problems on UNIX If Ingres has problems during shutdown on UNIX, follow these steps: 1. Check environment variables in the local user environment by entering the following commands at the operating system prompt. a. Verify that II_SYSTEM is set correctly: echo $II_SYSTEM /usr/r6 (this varies system by system) b. Check that you have the full sear ch path to $II_SYSTEM/ingres/bin and $II_SYSTEM/ingres/utility echo $PATH 2. If there is more than one Ingres installation on this machine, identify your installation code by typing the following command at the operating system prompt: ingprenv | grep II_INSTALLATION The two-letter installation code is displayed (for example, the code here is JB): II_INSTALLATION=JB Take note of your installation code: ______. 3. Identify if you are shutting down a client installation or a full installation by issuing the following command at the operating system prompt: ingprenv | grep II_CLIENT If this displays “II_CLIENT=true”, this is a client installation, and only two processes (iigcn, iigcc) are running on this node. 4. If you are having trouble shutting down a client installation because Ingres believes a Communications server is running locally when there is none, remove this file: $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/name/clientname/IICOMSVR_clientname For troubleshooting details see the Connectivity Guide . 5. Identify whether Ingres is recoveri ng aborted transactions. Details on recovery delays are described in Recovery Process Monitoring (see page 159).

If your site has more than one Ingres installation, examine the installation code associated with the iidbms process to make sure you are stopping only the processes associated with the installation you need to shut down. 9. Check that no shared memory segments remain allocated to this installation. Execute the operating system command: csreport The following message indicates that shared segments have been properly removed: !Can’t map system segment 10. If shared memory segments remain for this installation, interactively remove them: a. To deallocate shared memory resources, issue the operating system command: ipcclean b. Use the UNIX command ipcs to verify that the actual segments have been removed: ipcs c. If they have not been properly removed, you must delete them manually. Important! If your site has more than one Ingres installation, you must take care to only remove shared memory or semaphores for the installation to be shut down. If your machine contains more than one installation, enter the following command from the environment of the installation you need to target : csreport The csreport utility displays the shared memory and semaphore segment identifiers for this installation. To remove the targeted segment(s), use the UNIX command: ipcrm -m mid or ipcrm -s sid where mid is the shared memory segment identifier and sid is the semaphore identifier. 11. Verify that the following files are not present. If they are still present, you must remove them: $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/memory/lockseg.mem $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/memory/sysseg.mem Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems Troubleshooting Ingres 127 Your installation is now shut down. Instructions on how to check and restart Ingres are described in Check Ingres Installation on UNIX (see page 112). Note : For information about shutting down an Ingres installation that includes an ICE Server, see the chapter “Managing and Monitoring Web Deployment Option” in the Web Deployment Option User Guide . Check Shutdown Problems on VMS If Ingres has problems during shut down on VMS, follow these steps: 1. Check that you are logged in as the system administrator or another privileged account by issuing the following command at the operating system prompt: show process Make sure you have the WORLD and CMKRNL privileges required for stopping Ingres processes by issuing the following command at the operating system prompt: show process/privilege A privileged account must not only have the aforementioned VMS privileges but also must have the SERVER_CONTROL privilege authorized in II_CONFIG:CONFIG.DAT. 2. Check that the logical II_SYSTEM is defined by issuing the following command at the operating system prompt: show logical II_SYSTEM 3. Check to see that users are logged out of Ingres. You can use the utility logstat to determine which databases are open and active and find out whom to notify of the impending shutdown. For additional information, see the Logstat section in the Command Reference Guide . To obtain a list of running processes, use the DCL command: show system 4. This command gives you a complete list of all processes that are running on your machine. It displays the process ID ('Pid'), Process Name, and other information. The main processes have the names as shown in Detect Ingres Startup Problems on VMS (see page 118). If you use the form show system/full, you can also see the owner of the process. This is helpful if you have group level installations. Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems 128 System Administrator Guide 5. Identify your installation code if there is more than one Ingres installation on this machine. For a group level installation the two-lettered code is displayed after the process name.

Note: Ingres can be shut down in several ways. Following are some tips on how each shutdown procedure works to enable you to make a choice as to how to shut down the installation.  The ingstop utility shuts down servers in the following order: – Remote Command Server (rmcmd) – Star Server – DBMS Server – Protocol Bridge Server – Communications Server – Recovery and archiver processes-IUSV and ACP by rcp.config. – If present, the Cluster Server is also shut down. – Name Server  The following order also works. This ordering manually shuts down the installation, shutting down the Name Server first: – Name Server – Communications Server – Star Server Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems Troubleshooting Ingres 129 – DBMS Server – Recovery and archiver processes-IUSV and ACP a. Shutting down the Name Server When you issue the stop command from iinamu, the Name Server process is stopped. Once this command is issued, no new servers are allowed to register with the Name Server. Therefore, it makes sense to take the Name Server down first for a clean shutdown. Current, active sessions are not affected by this command. b. Shutting down the DBMS Server Use iimonitor to stop the DBMS Server. The two commands you can use are: set server shut This causes the server to refuse further connections and shuts the server down gracefully, completing all current transactions first, including the iimonitor session. stop server This stops the server immediately without waiting for current connected sessions to complete. Use this command instead of the VMS command stop/id. c. Shutting down the recovery and archiver processes Take down the recovery and the archiver processes, either quickly or slowly, depending on the method yo u used to take down the DBMS Server in step b. Use either of the following commands at the operating system prompt: rcpconfig/shutdown This causes the processes to refuse all further connections and transaction processing, but allows current transactions to finish. This allows the archiver and recovery processes to shut down cleanly. rcpconfig/imm_shutdown This stops all pending transactions and immediately shuts down the recovery and archiver processes. This leaves open transactions in the log file, which requires rollback (and slow startup) when the system is restarted. d. Writing a DCL command file to take Ingres down Alternatively, you can write a DCL script that puts the above steps in a command procedure to shut down each of the Ingres processes. Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems 130 System Administrator Guide 8. After shutting down Ingres, check that all processes are stopped: a. Issue the following command at the operating system prompt: show system Check to be sure that none of the processes listed in the Ingstart on VMS section is shown. b. If any of these installation processes are not shut down, note the process ID (PID#) of the running process and issue either of the following commands at the operating system prompt: stop process_name or stop/id = pid# Note: For serious system problems that require immediate attention, the VMS stop command can be used to stop an Ingres process. This is not recommended because it does not permit the recovery process to back out open transactions or the archiver process to flush the log file to disk. If this is a cluster installation, remember that these Ingres processes run on each node. Your Ingres installation is now shut down. Information about checking and restarting Ingres is described in Check Ingres Installation on VMS (see page 116).

View the Processes tab for the existence of the process. Ingres Processes on Windows Troubleshooting Ingres 133 Check for Recovery Process Errors on Windows The Recovery process (II_IUSV_ nnn) must be running before a DBMS Server can be started. Failure of the II_IUSV_ nnn starting process indicates one of the following:  Improper installation configuration, as described in Problems with Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration.  Problems with the log file  Insufficient shared memory If the Recovery process does not start, perform the following procedure: 1. Check for the existence of the transaction log by opening the Primary Transaction Log window in Configuration Manager (or the Transaction Log screen in the Configuration-By-Forms (cbf) utility), and noting the directories listed in the Log File Root Locations table in Configuration Manager (or the Primary Transaction Log Locations table in cbf). 2. In the ingres/log directory (located below all other listed directories), look for the file ingres_log.l nn where nn is an integer between 1 and 16. 3. Make the following checks on the transaction log file ingres_log.l nn: a. Verify that ingres_log.l nn exists at that location by entering the following command at the operating system prompt: dir b. If it does not exist, you must create it using the iimklog command, and format it using the rcpconfig -init command. 4.

Note: This step reinitializes the log file, causing any outstanding transactions to be lost. Ingres Processes on Windows 134 System Administrator Guide Check for Archiver Process Errors on Windows The archiver process (dmfacp) does not start unless the II_IUSV_ nnn recovery process is running. However, an Ingres installation runs without an archiver process until the log file fills up. The user programs are suspended until any outstanding transactions in the log file are backed out. More information about Ingres in a recovery state is provided in Recovery Proces (see page 159)s Monitoring. Archiver process (dmfacp) startup errors are likely to result from:  Improperly shared memory resource  Inability to read the transaction log file  Inability to write journal files Use the following procedure to check archiver process startup problems. Some of these checks are the same as for the recovery process in the previous section. 1. Make the following check on the transaction log file ingres.log: Verify that ingres.log exists at that location by entering the following command at the operating system prompt: dir If it does not exist, you must create it using the iimklog command, and format it using the rcpconfig –init command. 2. Check journal locations by verifying that: The journal location name points to a valid directory containing subdirectories ingres\\jnl\\default\\ dbname . 3. Check that the disk partition containing the journal files is not full. Issue the following command from the operating system prompt: dir If the journal partition is 100% full, this makes it impossible to write journals and stalls the archiver. If this is the reason preventing archiver start up, you must either free space on the journal partition or temporarily disable journaling with the alterdb command. For details on alterdb, see the Command Reference Guide . 4. If you corrected a recovery process problem, verify that Ingres starts normally. a. First, shut down the partially started installation with the ingstop command. b. Restart the installation with the ingstart command. Ingres Processes on Windows Troubleshooting Ingres 135 Check for DBMS Server Process Errors on Windows The command to start the DBMS Server process (iidbms) from the Ingres login is ingstart -iidbms. If the DBMS Server did not start: 1. Verify that the recovery process II_IUSV_ nnn is running, as described in Check for Recovery Process Errors on Windows (see page 133). 2. Verify that the recovery process II_IUSV_ nnn is not in a recovery state, as described in Recovery Process Monitoring (see page 159). This is a likely situation if there was a sudden shutdown because of a power failure or some other system failure. 3. Try to start the DBMS Server.

Verify that no local environment variables are set in the local user environment that contain the string “GCC”. At the operating system prompt type the command: BSD: printent | grep GCC System V: env | grep GCC The Ingres environment variable II_GCNxx_PORT is set in the Ingres symbol table. It is not visible from the UNIX environment using the printenv or env commands, but is visible in the Ingres environment. Verify this by typing ingprenv. 2. Check the value of the Ingres environment variable II_RUN with the following command entered at the operating system prompt: ingprenv a. If this machine is running Ingres Net, the value of II_RUN is either “,NET” or “,DBMS, NET”. If the value of the Ingres environment variable II_CLIENT is TRUE, II_RUN is “,NET”. If II_RUN is not set correctly, reset it using the command: ingsetenv II_RUN ', DBMS, NET' b. If this machine is an NFS client (that is, does not run a DBMS Server locally) the value of II_RUN is “,NET”. If II_RUN is not set correctly, reset it using the following command entered at the operating system prompt: ingsetenv II_RUN', NET' For details on setting environment variables, see the chapter \"Setting Environment Variables and Logicals.\" 3.

Issue the following command at the op erating system prompt to start the ICE Server: instart -icesvr Ingres Processes on UNIX 140 System Administrator Guide Recovery Process Errors on UNIX The recovery process (dmfrcp) must be running before a DBMS server can be started. Failure of the dmfrcp starting process indicates one of the following:  An improper installation configuration exists, as described in Troubleshoot Startup, Shutdown, or Configuration Problems (see page 108).  Problems with the log file  Insufficient or previously allocated system semaphores or shared memory  If configured for Ingres Cluster Solution, check that required OS prerequisites are installed and operational (for example, OpenDLM in a Linux environment). Check for Recovery Process Errors on UNIX If the recovery process does not start, perform the following procedure: 1. Check that the shared memory resources are properly installed. Use the csreport utility and check that the size, ownership, and permissions of the semaphore and shared memory segments meet the minimum requirements for your port. These are specified in the Getting Started guide. 2. Check for the existence of the transaction log by opening the Primary Transaction Log window in Configuration Manager (or the Transaction Log screen in the Configuration-By-Forms (cbf) utility), and noting the directories listed in the Log File Root Locations table in Configuration Manager (or the Primary Transaction Log Locations table in cbf). 3. Look for the file ingres_log.l nn (where nn is an integer between 1 and 16) in the ingres/log directory (located below all other listed directories). 4. Make the following checks on the transaction log file ingres_log.l nn: a. Verify that ingres_log.l nn exists at that location by entering the following command at the operating system prompt: ls -l If it does not exist, you must recreate it using the Configuration-By- Forms (cbf) or Configuration Manager (vcbf) utility. b. Verify that ingres_log.l nn is owned by installation owner. If it is not, issue the following command at the operating system prompt, where userid is the user ID of the installation owner: chown userid ingres_log Ingres Processes on UNIX Troubleshooting Ingres 141 c. If the transaction log file was created as: An ordinary UNIX file, make sure it has permissions 660 (that is, “-rw-rw----”). If not, issue the following command at the operating system prompt: chmod 660 ingres_log A raw log, permissions is “crw------”. Details on configuring a raw log file are in the Getting Started guide. 5. Verify that Ingres starts normally. a. Shut down the partially started installation with the ingstop command. b. Restart the installation with the ingstart command. 6. If you still cannot start the II_IUSV_ nnn process, you need to completely shut down the Ingres installation, re-run ingbuild, and reconfigure the log file. Important! This step must only be done as a last resort. Keep in mind that this reinitializes the log file, and any outstanding transactions are lost . To shut down the system, complete the following steps: a. Issue the command ingstop . b. Check Shutdown Problems on UNIX (see page 124). Work through that section until your Ingres installation has been cleanly shut down. Check for Remote Command Process on UNIX You can check for the presence of the remote command process by entering the following command at the operating system prompt: ps -ef | grep rmcmd Archiver Process on UNIX The archiver process (dmfacp) does not start unless the recovery (dmfrcp) process is running .

Some of these checks are the same as for the recovery process: 1. Check that the shared memory resources are properly installed: Use the csreport utility and check that the size, ownership and permissions of the semaphore and shared memory segments meet the minimum requirements for your port . For requirements, see the Readme file. The command to allocate Ingres shared memory and semaphores (when logged is as the installation owner) is csinstall . You can display them from UNIX with the command ipcs. 2. Make the following checks on the Ingres transaction log file “ingres_log”: a. Verify that “ingres_log” exists at th at location by entering the following command at the operating system prompt: ls -l If it does not exist, you must create it by running the ingbuild program. b. Verify that “ingres_log” is owned by the user that owns the installation. If not, issue the following command at the operating system prompt, where userid is the user who owns the installation: chown userid ingres_log c.

Issue the following command at the operating system prompt: infodb | grep ii_journal 3. Check journal locations by verifying that: a. The journal location name points to a valid directory containing subdirectories “ingres/jnl/default/dbname” b. The permissions on these directories are: - 755 for the ingres directory - 777 for the default directory Ingres Processes on UNIX Troubleshooting Ingres 143 4. Check that the disk partition containing the journal files is not 100% full . Issue the following command at the operating system prompt: df If a journal partition is 100% full, it is impossible to write journals and the Archiver stalls . If this is the reason preventing Archiver startup, you must either free space on the journal partition or temporarily disable journaling with the alterdb command . For details on alterdb, see the Command Reference Guide . 5. If you corrected an Archiver process problem, verify that Ingres starts normally: a. Shut down the partially started installation with the ingstop command. b. Restart the installation with the ingstart command. Check for DBMS Server Process Errors on UNIX The command to start the DBMS Server process (iidbms) from the installation owner login is ingstart -iidbms . If the DBMS Server did not start: 1. Verify that the recovery process (dmfrcp) is running . Details are descxribed in Recovery Process Errors on UNIX (see page 140). 2. Verify that the recovery process is not in a recovery state (see page 159). This is a likely situation if there was a sudden shutdown because of a power failure or some other systems failure. 3. Try to start up a DBMS server . Issue the following command at the operating system prompt: ingstart -iidbms 4. If you corrected a DBMS server prob lem, verify that Ingres starts normally: a.

See the copyapp and unloaddb command descriptions in the Command Reference Guide . b. Save this to make a test case for technical support. 3. If the immediate cause cannot be isolated, perform long-term diagnostics with II_DBMS_LOG . This diagnostic tool is especially valuable for fatal DMF errors. a. Set II_DBMS_LOG to capture a “snapshot” of the DBMS Server when it stops by setting it to the full path name of a file before starting the DBMS Server. For example: Windows: SET II_DBMS_LOG=%II_SYSTEM%\\ingres\\files\\dbms.log UNIX: C Shell: setenv II_DBMS_LOG $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/dbms_%p.trace Bourne Shell: II_DBMS_LOG = $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/dbms_%p.trace export II_DBMS_LOG At startup, the %p in the II_DBMS_LOG specification is replaced by the Process Identifier (PID) of the server process.

When the DBMS Server shuts down, information is dumped to the DBMS log file. You must rename the fi le before restarting Ingres or the new server overwrites the file. Prepare to send this file along with associated errors from the error log files to technical support for analysis. Database Connection Problems Database connection problems occur in the following scenarios:  If you cannot connect to any database  If you encounter errors while connecting to individual databases No Database Connections If you cannot connect to any database, follow these steps: 1. Check the errlog.log to see if there are any associated messages . These messages are often more informative than the message displayed on your screen and can quickly identify the source of failure . Check for associate messages in the errlog.log by using their timestamps. 2. Ensure that all your installation’s processes are running, as described in Check Ingres Installation on Windows (see page 110), Check Ingres Installation on UNIX (see page 112), and Check Ingres Installation on VMS (see page 116). 3. Run logstat to insure that the logging system status is ONLINE and not LOGFULL . If the status is not ONLINE, see How to Log System Issues (see page 169). 4. Use iinamu to interrogate the Name Server . (For additional information, see iinamu in the Command Reference Guide ). Type show ingres to verify that the DBMS Server has registered with the Name Server. 5. Use the iimonitor utility to see if you can connect to the DBMS Server . See iimonitor in the Command Reference Guide . If you can connect, at the “IIMONITOR>” prompt type show sessions to examine DBMS server activity. If you cannot connect to the DBMS Server, see How to Log System Issues (see page 169). Problems with Tools Startup 156 System Administrator Guide Check the Ingres environment variable/logical II_DBMS_SERVER: Windows: Use ingprenv and your system’s echo command to verify that II_DBMS_SERVER is not set, either in the Ingres symbol table or your local environment.

The main causes of inconsistent database errors are improper system administration procedures . These include:  Initializing the transaction log file with the -force_init_log flag of rcpconfig while the log file still contains open transactions  Moving or altering files or installation variables without using the appropriate utility such as ingbuild or unloaddb  Improper procedures when recovering Ingres data from operating system backups Inconsistent database errors can also be caused by hardware problems or software problems. For example, inconsistent database errors can be caused when the transaction log file or the configuration file has been corrupted by a hardware failure. Inconsistent database errors can also be caused by software bugs. In either case, contact technical support. Note: You can also use VDBA for database backup and recovery. For more information, see the Getting Started guide or the online help for VDBA. Automatic Recovery Ingres automatically handles the transaction failures that cause most database inconsistencies. Recovery During Normal Operation If a user program exits or a transaction is aborted for some other reason, the DBMS Server automatically handles transaction rollback . This does not cause an inconsistent database. Inconsistent Databases and Recovery 158 System Administrator Guide Recovery at Shutdown At shutdown, all users must have exited their sessions; therefore, all transactions are committed . If users exited their sessions abnormally, the DBMS Server aborts any open transactions associated with the aborted sessions . Very long transactions take time to roll back and cause ingstop to seem to hang . The DBMS Server process cannot exit normally until it finishes recovering the aborted transactions. If transactions are being rolled back on shutdown, allow the DBMS Server to finish this task before shutting down. If you do not, longer delays occur at startup time while the recovery process is performing rollback. Recovery at Startup If transactions have been aborted and were not recovered by a normal shutdown, upon restart the recovery process performs recovery . This occurs, for example, if:  Processes are forcibly killed from the operating system  The machine is rebooted  Power to the system is interrupted The recovery process performs the following steps upon startup: 1. Reads the transaction log file . If there has not been a normal shutdown, the recovery process detects that databases are inconsistent—that is, that Ingres previously exited without completing all the transactions required for system and database consistency . 2. Proceeds through the transaction log file to back out uncommitted transactions and complete committed fast-commit transactions until the databases are again in a consistent state . While recovery is proceeding, no user interfaces can connect to a database. Recovery actions are logged in the file $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/iircp.log. Note: When configured for the Ingres Cluster Solution, the log name has _nodename appended to the base log name. When the recovery process is complete, the message “Completed aborting transactions” is written to the RCP log file. Restart Ingres with the ingstart command. Users can reconnect to the databases.

No messages are printed to the screen. If you are in doubt as to whether recovery is taking place during startup, or to monitor the recovery process, use the following procedure. Display the recovery process log file by typing the following command at the operating system prompt: Windows: %II_SYSTEM%\\ingres\\files\\iircp.log UNIX: tail -f iircp.log VMS: II_SYSTEM:[INGRES.FILES]IIRCP.LOG _nodename If the system is recovering, the recove ry actions are logged to the IIRCP.LOG file. This indicates that Ingres is automatically recovering from possible inconsistencies. Messages are printed to the log file during recovery:  The message at the beginning of recovering transactions indicates that transaction recovery has begun.  Intermediate messages track recovery progress. As recovery proceeds, progress messages (for example, “Recovered 31 of 130 transactions”) are displayed.  When done, the following message is printed: Recovery complete. You can also use an operating system command to determine whether the recovery process is recovering transactions by checking to see if it is accumulating CPU time. Inconsistent Databases and Recovery 160 System Administrator Guide VMS: You can issue the following command at the operating system prompt several times: show process/cont/id= xxxx where: xxxx is the process ID of the recovery process. If the CPU time and disk I/O count taken by the process is increasing, the recovery process is most likely recovering transactions from the log file. UNIX: On UNIX, you can also monitor the files in the database directory of the database you suspect of being the target of the updates that are being backed out. The following command entered at the operating system prompt shows whether data files are being updated: ls -lt The file most recently updated is listed fi rst along with the time of last update. If any of the monitoring techniques above indicate that transaction recovery is taking place, continue to monitor the recovery process until recovery has completed. When the recovery process is complete, CPU time is not accumulated. After the recovery process has finished, restart the installation with the ingstart command. The ingstart utility first shuts down and brings up all required installation processes. Programs can connect to the databases. Inconsistent Database If you receive an “inconsistent database” error after recovery is complete, it means updates and modifications were not properly completed or rolled back, and the database is therefore in an inconsistent state. Following are examples of “inconsistent database” errors that indicate your database has become inconsistent: E_DM0100 DB_INCONSISTENT Database is inconsistent E_US0026 Database is inconsistent. Please contact the ingres system manager E_DM9327 BAD_OPEN_COUNT Inconsistent Databases and Recovery Troubleshooting Ingres 161 Diagnose an Inconsistent Database Diagnose the cause and extent of an inconsistent database problem before you attempt to recover your database. Knowing the cause of the problem is essential to choosing the proper recovery procedures. Once a database has been rolled forward from a checkpoint, recovered from an operating system backup, or forced consistent, you cannot determine the cause of inconsistency. To diagnose the cause and extent of an inconsistent database problem: 1. Read and save the full text of the error messages in errlog.log and iircp.log. 2. Using VDBA, choose infodb from the Database menu to read the database's configuration file and identify the cause of inconsistency. You can also enter the infodb command at the operating system prompt. If the configuration file can be opened and read, the cause of the inconsistency is displayed. Save the output of infodb for technical support. If the database's configuration file, \"aaaaaaaa.cnf\", cannot be read, it is corrupted. You need to recover from a backup, as described in Recover an Inconsistent Database (see page 166). 3. Review the history of your Ingres installation. Look for improper system administration procedures that have caused the database to become inconsistent. See the table in Common Causes of Inconsistent Databases (see page 161). 4.

Common Causes of Inconsistent Databases Common causes of inconsistent databases are:  Operating system backups  Incorrect installation paths  Disabling of logging/eecovery system  Use of unsupported hardware configuration Inconsistencies Due to Operating System Backups To recover a database from an operating system backup that was made while the installation was running, see Recover an Inconsistent Database (see page 166). Inconsistent Databases and Recovery 162 System Administrator Guide Inconsistencies Due to Incorrect Installation Paths Changing Ingres installation variab les (such as II_SYSTEM, II_DATABASE, II_CHECKPOINT, II_JOURNAL, II_DUMP, or II_WORK) without using proper procedures, causes inconsistency between the information stored in the installation variables and those stored in the database configuration file “aaaaaaaa.cnf”. Database inconsistency can occur if you move a database, table, application or some other object by using operating system commands rather than the supported Ingres utilities. If the inconsistency is the result of moving a database from another location or installation without using unloaddb, you must remove the database using destroydb, recreate the database using createdb, and repopulate the database using the unloaddb utility. For details, see the Database Administrator Guide. A database file can become corrupted fr om hardware or software failures of various kinds. A data file can be inadvertently deleted by hand, but this is rare because only the user who owns the installation can write to the database directories. If you are in doubt about whether transactions are being recovered, run the logstat utility and examine the “Status” fi eld. It is marked RECOVER if in the recovery state. While a recovery is taking place, for example when restarting after a system failure, the recovery proc ess requires time to read through the transaction log file to back out uncommitted transactions and complete fast-commit transactions. To users, the system appears to hang. Inconsistent Databases and Recovery Troubleshooting Ingres 163 Examine Configuration File of a Database To examine the configuration file of your database, use the VDBA Database, Infodb menu command. You can also enter the infodb command at the command prompt. 1. Compare the path information for the checkpoint, journal, data and dump locations with that defined for these environment variables and logicals as displayed by the following command: Windows: ingprenv UNIX: ingprenv VMS: show log ii 2. Return the installation logicals to the values displayed to by infodb, if the values have chanded. If these values are not the same, the installation logicals have been changed, or the database has been imported from some other Ingres installation. 3. If you need to change the existing values of Ingres installation variables or import a database from another site, you must use the unloaddb utility, as this creates a new, up-to-date configuration file for the database. For a discussion of Ingres environment variable and logicals that cause an inconsistent database if changed after installation is completed, see the chapter Environment Variables and Logicals. Inconsistent Databases and Recovery 164 System Administrator Guide Recovery Rules The following are some rules that you sh ould keep in mind about the recovery of transactions:  It takes at least as long to recover aborted transactions as it took to execute them originally.  The amount of time required for recovery depends on the number of users and transactions, transaction semantics (whether autocommit is set), and the consistency point interval.  While recovery is proceeding, all users are denied access to databases. Any attempt to connect to a database at this point returns an error such as the following: E_LQ0001_STARTUP gca protocol service request failure.  Database inconsistency can occur if a user or the system administrator attempts to “force” entry into the installation by running rcpconfig with the -force_init_log flag (thus erasing the transaction log file) before the recovery system has finished rolling back the uncommitted transactions during recovery. After a system failure, monitor recovery and always allow it to proceed until the “Recovery Complete” message appears in iircp.log. Inconsistent Databases and Recovery Troubleshooting Ingres 165 Inconsistencies Due to Disabling of Logging or Recovery System By disabling the logging or recovery system, the DBA can temporarily turn off logging for the database to speed bulk loading of data.

Inconsistent Databases and Recovery Troubleshooting Ingres 165 Inconsistencies Due to Disabling of Logging or Recovery System By disabling the logging or recovery system, the DBA can temporarily turn off logging for the database to speed bulk loading of data. If logging has been turned off for this database, a NOLOGGING error message appears in the error log file. Typically this message is: E_DM9050_TRANSACTION_NOLOGGING Database dbname has been updated by a session running with SET NOLOGGING defined. If the database has become inconsistent, you can check for this error message by typing the following command: Windows: findstr DM9050\\ %II_SYSTEM%\\ingres\\files\\errlog.log UNIX: grep DM9050 \\$II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/errlog.log VMS: search - II_SYSTEM:[INGRES.FILES]ERRLOG.LOG - DM9050 If the NOLOGGING error message appears, logging was disabled on this database. If the NOLOGGING message in the error log was written later than the most recent checkpoint of this database, the database must be restored from the checkpoint. To determine if this is the case, compare the timestamp on the error message in errlog.log with the timestamp in the “checkpoint history” field of the output from the command infodb dbname . For details on set nologging, see the Database Administrator Guide . Inconsistent Databases and Recovery 166 System Administrator Guide Database Inconsistencies Due to Use of Unsu pported Hardware Configurations in UNIX Database inconsistencies can be caused by the use of unsupported hardware configurations on NFS. In systems that include Network File System (NFS) mounts, be aware that Ingres:  Supports NFS client installation configurations in which the DBMS Server process and data directories on one node are accessed by application programs executing on another.  Does not support running DBMS servers on one node and accessing data directories on another network node using NFS. The configuration can cause undetected write errors that lead to database inconsistency. To check your configuration, type mount at the operating system prompt. Make sure that the data director ies (II_DATABASE, II_CHECKPOINT, II_JOURNAL and II_LOG_FILE) are not NFS-mounted from a remote node. For a description of the supported NFS client installation procedures, see Getting Started. Recover an Inconsistent Database The recommended method of recovering an inconsistent database is to use rollforwarddb from VDBA. You can also enter this command from the command line. If no Ingres checkpoint exists, you can recover from an operating system backup. Make Inconsistent Database Consistent The recommended way to make your inconsistent database consistent is to use rollforwarddb. It recovers the database from a previous checkpoint and, if journaling was enabled, applies the associated journals. For the full procedure, see the Database Administrator Guide . Use of Operating System Backup Ingres does not support nor recommend the use of operating system backups as your primary means of ensuring database recoverability. The Ingres checkpoint and journaling programs provide the secure way to ensure that your data is recoverable. Important! Operating system backups must be used only as a last resort, when Ingres checkpoints have been lost or destroyed, and only under the direction of technical support. Inconsistent Databases and Recovery Troubleshooting Ingres 167 When No Backup Exists If you have an inconsistent database for which no checkpoints or operating system backups exist, you can still gain access to that database and attempt to salvage the data using the verifydb utility. The verifydb utility can be used to unset the “inconsistent database” flag in the configuration file “aaaaaaaa.cnf”. This permits access to the database; however, it does nothing to actually make the data consistent. If verifydb is used to force access to a database that is inconsistent, the state of the database remains unknown. Such a database becomes unsupportable by technical support. Data can be lost and problems occur weeks or months later. Technical support cannot diagnose the state of such a database because the built-in consistency checks have been overridden. The format “verifydb -oforce_consistent” does not recover a database. It merely allows access and continued operation to a database that is in an inconsistent state. Gain Emergency Access to an Inco nsistent Database Using verifydb If you must use verifydb to gain emergency access to data in an inconsistent database, do so as follows: 1. Save all information, as outlined in What You Need Before Contacting Technical Support (see page 179). 2. Back up the database directory at the operating system level. 3. Run verifydb in report mode by typing the following command at the operating system prompt: verifydb -mreport -sdbname \"dbname\" -odbms_catalogs -u$ingres Verifydb output is logged in $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/iivdb.log: 4.

Performance Problems 168 System Administrator Guide Performance Problems Most performance problems stem from multiple causes. A complete performance analysis must include each item in the Diagnostic Hierarchy section below. But if you need to resolve a specific performance problem quickly, focus your attention on that area. The information in this troubleshooting section is designed to assist you in resolving a performance issue after first isolating which factors are influencing performance. Use the procedures in this section if an Ingres tool “hangs,” that is, your program seems to start but nothing happens. Other programs such as SQL display header information, but when you issue a command, nothing happens. Flow Diagram for Troubleshooting Performance Problems Use the following flow chart to identi fy and isolate a system performance problem: Performance Problems Troubleshooting Ingres 169 Diagnose DBMS Server Due to Logging System Problem Use the following procedure to diagnose a DBMS server that is not responding due to logging system problems. 1. Check the logging system by issuing the following command at the operating system prompt to invoke the logstat utility: Windows: logstat | more UNIX: logstat | more VMS: define sys$output filename logstat deassign sys$output 2. If you are unable to start up logstat, the recovery process (see page 159) has probably taken an exclusive lock and is in recovery. 3. If logstat starts up, check the status field, as described in Logstat Status Fields (see page 169). Logstat Status Fields The problem states and resolutions of logstat fields are described in the following table: Status Field Description Action ONLINE, ECPDONE A consistency point is completed. The system is fully functional and online.The logging system has finished a consistency point. This status flag is present most of the time while the logging system is functioning normally. If this is your status, stop this procedure and review Operating System Resources. Performance Problems 170 System Administrator Guide Status Field Description Action LOGFULL The log file is full. A status of LOGFULL means that the system is suspended from processing new requests because there is no more room in the transaction log file. It remains so until the problem is corrected. Examine the other status field entries. If ARCHIVE is also indicated, the Archiver is actively processing the log file to free up space. The LOGFULL condition is removed when the Archiver is finished. CPNEEDED A consistency point is needed. CPNEEDED means the logging system is about to take a consistency point. ARCHIVE The Archiver is processing. The status ARCHIVE means the Archiver process is archiving. START_ARCHIVER The Archiver has stopped. A status of START_ARCHIVER means that the archiver process stopped. Restart the Archiver. FORCE_ABORT The force-abort- limit has been reached. If the status is FORCE_ABORT, a transaction came too close to the end of the transaction log file before the oldest was committed to disk, and reached the force-abort- limit. The oldest open transaction is aborted to free space for the new one. You can use logstat (or ipm) to monitor the force abort. The system frees the FORCE_ABORT status when the abort operation is completed. RECOVER The recovery process is performing recovery. If the status is RECOVER, the logging system is in recovery, a normal mode. Recovery requires some time because Ingres is optimized to commit rather than back out of transactions. Performance Problems Troubleshooting Ingres 171 Important! If the server is recovering a lengthy transaction, be aware that shutting down the server with iimonitor's \"stop server\" (or by killing processes at the operating system level) results in slower recovery. Allow the recovery to proceed normally. You can monitor the progress of the recovery with logstat and iimonitor or the ipm utility . Many other normal states appear on the status line. For additional information on reading logstat output, see the Logstat section in the Command Reference Guide .

If the log file size is increased, check the “percentage of logfile written” before a consistency point is taken. For details, see the ipm, logstat, or VDBA output.  Avoid continuous transaction errors by: – Setting autocommit on where applicable – Avoiding application errors that are caused by beginning transactions before they get all the user input required or by failing to use Ingres application timeout features. (Timeout features are discussed in the SQL Reference Guide and Forms-based Application Development Tools User Guide. Also, for a discussion of transaction processing, see the SQL Reference Guide .  If you have taken the above precautions but still get log full/abort, the transaction log is sized too small for the types of transactions you need to process. Read the tips in the next section on choosing the correct transaction log file size.  Use set log_trace to examine the size and type of log records being written to the log file. Process of Resizing Transaction Logs Resizing transaction logs involves these steps: 1. Determine whether the log requires resizing 2. Resize the transaction log file 3. Reestablish Dual Logging Performance Problems 172 System Administrator Guide Determine Whether a Log Requires Resizing To determine whether a log requires resizing, use one of the following procedures. Using VDBA’s Performance Monitor, start a monitoring session on the desired node: 1. Select the node in the left pane and click the Monitor toolbar button. 2. Select Log Information in the branch. 3. Click the Header tab in the right pane to display log usage. Start the Interactive Performance Monitor utility (ipm). 1. Highlight the Log_info menu item and select the Select option. 2. Highlight the Header menu item and select the Select option. 3. The Log file Diagram shows the percentage use of the Transaction Log. 4. Exit the ipm program. Find the current peak transaction load by using the logstat utility to monitor the amount of log file that is in use during your peak hours. This allows you to choose the correct size for your log file. Because requirements change, you must monitor the log file regularly. 1. Enter the logstat command. 2. Find the value under % of log file in use. 3. If the log file needs to be resized, select the new size. UNIX: Use mkrawlog to reconfigure a raw log file. 4. Shut down the Ingres installation by entering the ingstop command. Performance Problems Troubleshooting Ingres 173 Resize the Transaction Log File To resize the transaction file, follow these steps: 1. Shut down the Ingres installation by entering the ingstop command. 2. Start the Configuration-By-Forms (cbf) or Configuration Manager (vcbf) utility. a. Choose Transaction Log from the menu. The file name is displayed alon g with the current size of the Transaction Log. b. Choose Destroy. When destroyed, the Transaction Log information table is emptied. c. Select the Create option. d. Enter the required Transaction Log file size in megabytes. The transaction log is created. 3. Exit cbf or vcbf. 4. Restart the Ingres installation by entering the command ingstart. For details, see the Getting Started guide. Important! Reconfiguring your log file destroys the current contents of the file and leaves an empty, reinitialized log file after the reconfiguration is complete. When Ingres is shut down, all transactions are written to disk; therefore, to prevent inconsistent data base problems, reconfigure the log file only after a successful Ingres installation shutdown procedure. Resource and Maintenance Problems 174 System Administrator Guide Reestablish Dual Logging A failure in one of the two dual log files is most often symptomatic of hardware problems. In the event of such a failure, you must reestablish dual logging at the first opportunity. To re-establish dual logging after a failure of one of the log files, follow these steps: 1.

Resource and Maintenance Problems Good performance requires planning and regular maintenance. Make sure your operating system is configured with sufficient resources for Ingres. Insufficient system resources cause poor performance or prevent Ingres from starting. Resource and Maintenance Problems Troubleshooting Ingres 175 Tools for Identifying Operating System Problems The following tools can help you identify operating system resource problems:  Review the minimum requirements for a basic Ingres installation given in the Readme file . If your particular environment requires more resources, use the Ingres utilities to verify that there are enough resources.  System resources can be monitored by some operating system utilities. Syntax details are described in Unix Operating System Utilities (see page 187). UNIX: BSD: pstat utility—to display the status of UNIX system tables and system swap space vmstat utility—to display virtual memory status System V:  sar utility—to display activity of various system resources such as CPU utilization, swapping activity, and disk activity.  show memory—displays the system memory resources and the amount of non-paged dynamic memory (total, free and in use).  show process/id=pid/continuous—displays the amount of page faulting, working set, buffered I/O, and direct I/O the server is doing.  show device—indicates if a particular disk drive is out of disk space.  show device /files—if there is a problem starting an installation, this command can be used to make sure that an Ingres process is not holding on to a mailbox. The installation utility allows the examination of all Ingres installed images, showing the amount of glob al pages and sections available and used. VMS: The following VMS tools are very us eful for tracing script problems:  set verify—allows you to see the commands used in the installation script or any other VMS command procedure.  set watch file/class=major (requires CMEXEC VMS privilege)—allows all the files that are being accessed to be displayed. This assists in diagnosing if a location of a file or library is being incorrectly referenced. Use this command when debugging Ingres processes interactively.  The displays can be turned off with the following command entered at the operating system prompt: Resource and Maintenance Problems 176 System Administrator Guide Important! This is an unsupported VM S command. Use at your own risk. set watch file/class=none. Syntax details are described in VMS Operating System Utilities (see page 193). Diagnose Poor Performance Due to Insufficient System Resources If Ingres seems slow or unresponsive for no apparent reason, follow these steps to diagnose the problem. Write down any error messages you receive when performing these steps: 1. Connect to your DBMS Server through Ingres monitors: a. First display the server_number of your DBMS Server using the iinamu utility: iinamu IINAMU> show ingres b. Connect to the DBMS Server monitor by typing the command: iimonitor server_number c.

Resource and Maintenance Problems Troubleshooting Ingres 177 3. If the session alternates between CS_EVENT_WAIT and CS_COMPUTABLE, this indicates that the query is processing. However, if the query is taking an excessive amount of time, set up a trace on it, as described in Trace Utilities (see page 206). a. Interrupt the query that is running:  Interactively , use Ctrl+C and wait.  In batch or background mode , use the following command to terminate: Windows: In the Task Manager, highlight iidbmst and click on End Process UNIX: kill pid VMS: stop process/id = pid where pid is the process ID of the query. Important! The command format “stop proc” must be used only as a last resort. Use of this option can cause more problems than it solves. b. Issue the command set gep.  Rerun the query. This outputs a query execution plan.  Alternatively, start an SQL window on the database in VDBA and click the Display Query Execution Pl an button to graphically display the query plan.  It is important to note that interrupting a query requires some time because Ingres is optimized to commit rather than back out of transactions. It takes at least as long to back out of a transaction as to process the transaction normally. The transaction must be fully backed out before sessions can resume and locks are freed. 4. It is useful to note whether the quer y runs differently when called from other Ingres tools . For example, try issuing the same query from Interactive SQL, and Embedded SQL 5. Determine if you can access all of the data in the tables in all components of the query. a. From the Terminal Monitor type: select count(*) from tablename Resource and Maintenance Problems 178 System Administrator Guide This verifies that Ingres can sequentially access every row in the table and indicates that other access paths (secondary indexes, hash pointers, B-Tree page pointers, and so on) can cause the problem . Queries using restrictive where clauses probably are using these secondary access methods. b. Check for permits that apply to this data by typing the following command from the Terminal Monitor: help permit tablename c. Check for restrictions that you have placed on this data through the Knowledge Management Extension features, such as database rules . From the Terminal Monitor enter the following query to determine if a table is subject to restrictions imposed by a database rule: select * from iirules where table_name = 'tablename' Alternatively, in the right pane of VDBA’s Database Object Manager (DOM) window:  Select the Databases branch and the desired database  Select Tables and the desired table_name  Select Rules What You Need Before Contacting Technical Support Troubleshooting Ingres 179 What You Need Before Contacting Technical Support Before contacting technical support, ga ther as much information as possible and have the following information available.

Operating System Utilities Many operating systems provide utilities to administer and troubleshoot. Most of the operating systems provide context sensitive help to use the tools. Windows Operating System Utilities You can use the following Windows operating system utilities to monitor Ingres:  Windows Diagnostics  Windows Performance Monitor  Windows Event Viewer  Windows Registry Editor  Windows Task Manager For a full description of the Windows utilities, see your Windows documentation. Windows Diagnostics The Windows Diagnostics program can help you determine your operating system’s configuration. This tool can be found in Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Computer Management. Operating System Utilities 186 System Administrator Guide Windows Performance Monitor Performance Monitor is a Windows graphical tool for measuring the performance of your own computer or other computers on a network. On each computer, you can view the behavior of objects such as processors, memory, cache, threads, and processes. Each of these objects has an associated set of counters that provide information on such things as device usage, queue lengths, and delays, as well as information used for throughput and internal congestion measurements. It provides charting, alerting, and reporting capabilities that reflect current activity along with ongoing logging. You can also open log files at a later time for browsing and charting as if they were reflecting current activity. To monitor performance on Windows, see the operating system documentation. Windows Event Viewer Event Viewer is a tool for monitoring ev ents in your system. You can use Event Viewer to view and manage System, Se curity, and Application event logs. To access the Event Viewer, right-click on the My Computer icon and select Manage. The Computer Management Window is displayed. The Event Viewer is available under the System Tools. Windows Registry Editor This program can be used to view the system configuration and environment. For a description of how the information is presented and the capabilities of the utility, see the online help. Use REGEDIT32 To start the Registry Editor, run REGEDT32.EXE from File Manager or Program Manager, or type start REGEDT32 in a command window. The Registry Editor program has a similar view to the File Manager program. Windows Task Manager The Task Manager enables you to monitor and control your computer and what is running on it. It shows you programs and processes that are running as well as performance. To access the Task Manager, right click an empty area in the task bar and click Task Manager. Operating System Utilities Using Monitoring and Tracing Tools 187 UNIX Operating System Utilities You can use the following UNIX operating system utilities to monitor Ingres:  ps  iostate  pstat  sar  sdysdef  vmstat For a full description of the UNIX options, see your UNIX documentation (or online help). A detailed description of the utilities can be found in the Command Reference Guide . Note: Not all of the utilities are present on every UNIX system. Some are present only in a BSD or System V environment but not both. ps This command provides virtual memory and cpu information on each active process submitted from your account.

Operating System Utilities Using Monitoring and Tracing Tools 189 pstat (BSD) Print Statistics utility is useful for examining system tables and system swap space. The command /etc/pstat –s, shows system swap space activity. An example output: 589944 used, 667364 free, 61864 wasted avail (num*size): 316*2048 5*1024 6*512 13*256 21*128 38*64 54*32 Note : For a description of the output units, see your operating system guide or online MAN pages. On some machines output is in bytes (as in this example). On others it is in units equal to the machine’s page size. The command /etc/pstat -T gives a list of used and free slots in various system tables. Here is a sample output: 1717/3216 files 937/2384 inodes 333/1300 processes 266/325 mfiles 595176/1256780 swap The pstat utility can be used to give other useful information if the user has knowledge of the UNIX kernel. It can tell you, for example, the state of a running process, which files are open, which operating system locks apply and which processes have which files open. Operating System Utilities 190 System Administrator Guide sar (System V) The sar (System Activity Reporter) command can be used to list CPU utilization statistics, disk and swapping activity, and other status options. The UNIX sar command samples cumulative activity counters in the operating system and reports on various system activities. Just a few of the reports available that are of use for the system administrator are CPU utilization, disk activity, and swapping activi ty. See examples below. There are many other options available, including reports on unused memory pages and disk blocks (swap space), and message and semaphore activity. For the system administrator, sar is an indispensable tool.  The command sar -u 5 , shows CPU utilization output as in the following sample output: 06:38:26 %usr %sys %wio %idle 06:38:31 1 3 96 0 This output shows the portion of CPU time spent running in user mode, system mode, idle with some process waiting for block I/O, or otherwise idle.  The command sar -d 5 , shows disk activity output as in the following sample output: 06:39:53 device %busy avque r+w /s blks/s avwait avserv 06:39:53 disc0-0 16 13.6 6 17 349.6 29.7 disc0-5 0 1.0 0 2 0.0 20.0 The display shows the portion of time the device was busy servicing requests (%busy), the average number of outstanding requests (avque), the number of data transfers (r+w/s), the number of bytes transferred in 512-byte units (blk/s), the average time in milliseconds that requests wait idly on queue (avwait), and the average time for requests to be serviced (avserve).  The command sar -w 5 shows swapping activity ou tput as in the following sample output: 06:40:45 swpin/s bswin/s swpot/s bswot/s pswch/s 06:40:50 0.00 0.0 0.00 0.0 19 The fields swpin/s, swpot/s are the num ber of swap transfers.

Check your operating system documentation for availability of these useful vendor-specific utilities. Error Messages Using Monitoring and Tracing Tools 197 Error Messages Errors in Ingres can be classified into Fatal and Non-Fatal errors. Ingres displays error messages in a particular format. This format helps you find the specific problem that Ingres has encountered. Error messages and their formats are explained in the following sections. Error Message Format Error messages in Ingres consist of a three-part error code and accompanying message text. The code segment has the format: E_FCxxxx_msg message text The message codes are as follows: E_, I_, or W_ E_ (error message), I_(informational message), or W_ (warning message). FC Two-letter Facility Code (see page 198). xxxx 4-digit hexadecimal number that represents the value returned to the application for use in error handling. The 2-letter facility code combined with the 4-digit hexadecimal number uniquely identifies this error code. _msg “msg” is an abbreviated message text or decimal number. As a decimal, it is always equivalent in value to the preceding hexadecimal number. Message Help Files Help is available online to aid in reading error messages. The error messages are stored in a single file messages.txt in the directory $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/english/messages/. Error Messages 198 System Administrator Guide Fatal Errors Fatal errors are those errors that require correction before Ingres can proceed with the program. All errors, including fatal errors, are recoverable. Fatal errors occur in the following categories:  Ingres tools, such as QBF or ABF  Ingres server errors – Environmental OS/hardware limits and problems – A command limit is reached, for example, exceeding the maximum number of aggregates in a query – System software error To remove the cause of a fatal error, use the troubleshooting techniques in the chapter Troubleshooting Ingres. Non-Fatal Errors Non-fatal errors are diagnostic indications of user errors, usually in application development. For example, a non-fatal error code is returned when a user attempts to destroy a non-existent table. These errors are not severe and do not halt the user program or Ingres. User applications can choose to print or suppress these errors. Ingres Facility Codes Ingres facility codes consist of a two-character code that is generated by a particular facility. For example, the Abst ract Data Type Facility has a facility code of AD so error messages generated by this facility have an error message format of: E_ADxxxx_msg Error messages often include an explicit reference to which internal Ingres function returned the error. A list of these modules and their functions can help you identify the source of errors requiring troubleshooting. Error Messages Using Monitoring and Tracing Tools 199 Facility Codes for Primary Components The facility codes for the primary Ingres components, such as the DBMS Server and General Communications Facility, are shown in the following table: Facility Code Facility AD Abstract Data Type Facility (ADF) DM Data Manipulation Facility (DMF)"

The error log contains the following information:  Error messages  Warning messages  Archiver shutdown  DBMS server start up and shutdown The system administrator maintains the error log file. The file continues to grow until manually truncated. The installation must be shut down before truncating or removing the errlog.log file. Archiver Log The archiver log contains information about the current archiver process. The archiver log file (iiacp.log) is located in the $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files directory. This file is appended to when the archiver process starts. The log contains the following information:  Archiver start up  Archiver error messages  Archiver warning messages Log Files 204 System Administrator Guide Recovery Log The recovery log (dmfrcp) contains information about the current recovery process. The recovery log file (iircp.log) is located in the $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/ directory. This file is appended to when the recovery process starts. The log contains the following information:  Current logging and locking parameter values  Recovery process error messages  Recovery process warning messages  Recovery operations information The recovery log must be monitored if you are unable to connect to Ingres and suspect that the DBMS Server is in recovery mode. Primary Configuration Log Files Ingres maintains transcripts of various configuration operations. The primary configuration log files that Ingres uses are as follows: config.log The config.log file contains a log of the changes made with the Configuration Manager or Configur ation-By-Forms (cbf) utility. rcpconfig.log The rcpconfig.log file contains log and error information of the last time rcpconfig was run. For details of the rcpconfig command, see the Command Reference Guide . The primary configuration log files are located in the $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/ directory. Log Files Using Monitoring and Tracing Tools 205 Optional Configuration Log Files Configuration log files that are optionally maintained are follows. These files, if present, are in the directory indicated by II_CONFIG: iilink.log This log is used only in conjunction with the Object Management Extension. The file contains a log of the last time the iilink command was run. For details on the iilink command, see the Object Management Extension User Guide. iivdb.log Contains a transcript of the last time verifydb was used to diagnose or attempt recovery of a damaged or inconsistent database. This file is created the first time verifydb is run lartool.log Contains a transcript, with any errors, of the last time lartool was used to manually abort or commit a running transaction. This file is created the first time lartool is run. Other Optional Log Files The following types of optional log files are present on your installation:  Individual process logs. For the following processes you can set up a separate log file to isolate the error messages relating to that process: – DBMS – GCC You normally do this only for a specific troubleshooting purpose. The default is that these messages are sent to the errlog.log. If you define one of these separate error logs, all messages are sent to both that file and errlog.log.  Trace log for tracking messages at a greater level of detail  Log for an optional Ingres facility Trace Utilities 206 System Administrator Guide These optional log and trace log files can be established by setting the associated Ingres variables: DBMS Error log The DBMS error log, optionally defined as a separate file. This log file is established by setting the Ingres variable II_DBMS_LOG to a user file name For additional information, see the appendix “Environment Variables and Logicals.” The default is all DBMS server errors and messages are sent to errlog.log. GCC error log The GCC error log, for installations using Ingres Net. This is in a user-defined file. This log file is established by setting II_GCC xx_LOG to the full name of a file. The error logging level is specified by II_GCC xx_LOG_LVL. These Ingres environment variables/logicals are listed in the appendix “Environment Variables and Logicals.” GCC trace log The GCC trace log is set up for specific troubleshooting efforts. You set II_GCA_LOG to a user file name. The associated Ingres variable II_GCC_TRACE defines the level of tracing. These Ingres environment variables/logicals are listed in the appendix “Environment Variables/Logicals.” Details on using a GCC trace are descried in User-Server Communications (see"

Star error log The Star error log for installations running Ingres Distributed Option, if defined. This log file is established by setting the Ingres variable II_STAR_LOG to a user file name. For additional information, see the appendix “Environment Variables and Logicals.” The default is all Distributed Option errors and messages are sent to errlog.log. Trace Utilities Commands are available to trace such things as disk file access, locks, user interface-to-DBMS server communications, query plans of the Ingres Query Optimizer and various types of memory usage. For more information on tracing, see the Database Administrator Guide . DBMS server tracing is generally enab led by some form of the set command, although some forms of tracing make use of Ingres environment variables and logicals. Set commands used specifically for debugging and troubleshooting are discussed in this document. More general set commands are documented in the SQL Reference Guide . Trace Utilities Using Monitoring and Tracing Tools 207 ODBC Call-level Interface The Ingres ODBC Call-level Interface (C LI) follows the existing convention of ODBC tracing as performed by the UNIX ODBC Driver Manager and Microsoft ODBC Driver Manager. Registry or conf iguration files are scanned for trace and trace log settings. Tracing output is similar to what is currently provided by the Ingres ODBC tracing DLL on Windows. Optionally, an application can set standard ODBC tracing using the foll owing Ingres environment variables: II_ODBC_LOG A string indicating the path and file name of an ODBC trace file. For example, the path and file name of an ODBC trace file for UNIX and Linux is \\tmp\\odbc.log and for Windows is c:\\temp\\odbc.log. II_ODBC_TRACE A positive integer with a value of 1, 3, or 5. A setting of 1 provides standard ODBC tracing and is the most useful for debugging ODBC CLI applications. A setting of 3 includes ODBC function entry calls in the Ingres ODBC driver (as opposed to the ODBC CLI driver manager). A setting of 5 displays information about internal function entries in the Ingres ODBC driver. If an ODBC application does not use the Ingres ODBC CLI, the ODBC trace settings of 3 and 5 are still recognized, but the setting of 1, which belongs to the driver manager component, is not. However, the existing tracing capability for third-party driver managers is unaffected. In this case, the driver manager tracing is written to the ODBC trace log as specified in the registry (Windows) or odbcinst.ini file (UNIX and Linux), but the detailed tracing information is written to the log file as specified by the II_ODBC_LOG environment variable. Set Statement The set statement is used to specify a number of runtime options and has the general format: set [no]option [additional parameters ]; The option is set on or active by set option or set option on (depending on the option). It is turned off by a corresponding set nooption or set option off. Additional parameters are required, depending on the option. For a detailed syntax description of the set statement, see the SQL Reference Guide. Trace Utilities 208 System Administrator Guide Environment Variables and Logicals Commonly Used with Set Set statements are executed as part of query language startup procedures at selected levels of scope. A set statement is entered directly at a terminal for temporary settings or executed using an Ingres environment variable/logical to establish a default option setting for all users. Several levels are shown in the following table: Where Specified Scope of Effect ING_SYSTEM_SET Executed whenever Ingres is started up, affecting all users ING_SET Executed whenever any Ingres tool connects to a server ING_SET_DBNAME Affects only Ingres tools starting up on the specified database II_EMBED_SET Similar to ING_SET, but diagnostic output is to a file set statement entered directly In effect until changed by a subsequent set statement for the option. This occurs by another direct set statement or using any of the Ingres environment variables and logicals above reestablishing the default.

Trace Utilities Using Monitoring and Tracing Tools 209 Example: Set Statement Entered Directly One or more set options can be specified using the _SET environment Ingres environment variables and logicals. They can be assigned directly from the operating system shell. Separate multiple set statements by semicolons (up to a limit of 64 characters), as shown in the following examples: Windows: SET ING_SET=set nojournaling;set printqry UNIX: C Shell: setenv ING_SET \"set nojournaling; set printqry\" Bourne Shell: ING_SET = \"set nojournaling; set printqry\" export ING_SET VMS: DEFINE ING_SET \"SET NOJOURNALING; SET PRINTQRY\" Trace Utilities 210 System Administrator Guide Example: Set Statements in an Include File Set statements can also be implemented by means of an include statement. The include statement allows you to place the set statements in a file and specify the file name in the setenv (or equivalent) command. Use of the include option also avoids the 64-character line limit. For example: Windows: set ING_SET=include c:\\extra\\ingres\\set.ing UNIX: C Shell: setenv ING_SET \"include /extra/ingres/set.ing\" Bourne Shell: ING_SET = \"include /extra/ingres/set.ing\" export ING_SET VMS: DEFINE ING_SET -\"INCLUDE DUA0:[EXTRA.INGRES]SET.ING\" The file set.ing includes the following statements: set autocommit on; set lockmode on mastertable where level = page, maxlocks = 10; Set Statements in Startup Files Set statements are automatically executed as part of query processor start up. Various startup defaults are enabled either by setting an Ingres environment variable/logical (such as ING_SET or II_EMBED_SET described above) or by including these set statements in one of the query processor startup files. For an alphabetical listing of Ingres environment variables/logicals, see the appendix “Environment Variables and Logicals.” Trace Utilities Using Monitoring and Tracing Tools 211 Set Options for Tracing Queries Set options of special interest in query troubleshooting include:  [no]printqry: Set query display on or off.  [no]qep: Set query execution plan display on or off.  joinop [no]timeout: Set optimizer timeout on or off. The set printqry Option The command set printqry prints out the query before it is optimized and executed. This is especially useful when evaluating queries for performance tuning or troubleshooting. Example: Turn Query Display On Using ING_SET The following command turns query display on: Windows: SET ING_SET=set printqry UNIX: C Shell: setenv ING_SET \"set printqry\" Bourne Shell: ING_SET = \"set printqry\" export ING_SET VMS: DEFINE ING_SET \"SET PRINTQRY\" As an example, assume that QBF is started up. The following is displayed: Query Buffer: set Autocommit on Query Parameters: Query Buffer: select cap_value, cap_capability from iidbcapabilities Query Parameters: Query Buffer: select user_name, dba_name from iidbconstants Query Parameters: Trace Utilities 212 System Administrator Guide Example: Turn Query Displa y On Using II_EMBED_SET The following command turns query display on through II_EMBED_SET. This is similar to the ING_SET environment variable/logical. All information is gathered in the client application and printed to the log by the library routines linked to the client application: Windows: SET II_EMBED_SET=printqry UNIX: C Shell: setenv II_EMBED_SET \"printqry\" Bourne Shell: II_EMBED_SET = \"printqry\" export II_EMBED_SET VMS: DEFINE II_EMBED_SET \"PRINTQRY\" The query output with query timings is placed into a file called iiprtqry.log. Here is a sample output: Query text: select * from iirelation Query Send Time: Thu Mar 26 17:20:43 2001 Query Response Time: Thu Mar 26 17:20:44 2001 Response CPU Time: 2630 Qry End CPU Time: 3370 This type of query monitoring can be useful for spotting slow-running queries in applications. Trace Utilities Using Monitoring and Tracing Tools 213 The set qep Option The set qep option provides a display of the optimizer’s query execution plan (QEP) for the query after it has been optimized but before it is executed. The following command turns QEP displa y on as the default ING_SET level: Windows: SET ING_SET=set qep UNIX: C Shell: setenv ING_SET \"set qep\" Bourne Shell: ING_SET = \"set qep\" export ING_SET VMS: DEFINE ING_SET \"SET QEP\" The Ingres Query Optimizer and QEPs are described in detail in the Database Administrator Guide. The set joinop notimeout Option The set joinop notimeout option can be used in tracing query performance. This statement turns the optimizer timeout feature off. With timeout on, the optimizer stops checking for further query execution plans when it believes that the best plan it has found takes less time to execute than the amount of time already spent searching for a plan. If you issue a set joinop notimeout statement, the optimizer continues searching query plans. This option is often used with the set qep option to ensure that the optimizer is picking the best possible query plan. Canceling Set"

If you issue a set joinop notimeout statement, the optimizer continues searching query plans. This option is often used with the set qep option to ensure that the optimizer is picking the best possible query plan. Canceling Set Options To cancel any of these options that have been set, you issue the opposite set statement (set nooption to turn an option off or set option in the case of joinop notimeout to restore the default behavior). Trace Utilities 214 System Administrator Guide The set session with on_error Option The following set statement enables you to specify how transaction errors are handled in the current session: set session with on_error = rollback statement| transaction To direct Ingres to roll back the effects of the entire current transaction if an error occurs, specify rollback transaction. To direct Ingres to roll back only the current statement (the default), specify rollback statement. To determine the current status of transaction error handling, issue the select dbmsinfo(’on_error_state’) statement. Specifying rollback transaction reduces logging overhead, and help performance; the performance gain is offset by the fact that, if an error occurs, the entire transaction is rolled back, not the single statement that caused the error. The following errors always roll back the current transaction, regardless of the current transaction error-handling setting:  Deadlock  Forced abort  Lock quota exceeded To determine if a transaction was aborted as the result of a database statement error, issue the statement select dbmsinfo(’on_error_state’). If the error aborted the transaction, this statement returns 0, indicating that the application is currently not in a transaction. You cannot issue the set session with on_error statement from within a database procedure or multi-statement transaction. Trace Utilities Using Monitoring and Tracing Tools 215 I/O Tracing The set option io_trace prints out information about disk I/O during the life of each query. The following command turns I/O trace on as the default ING_SET level: Windows: SET ING_SET=set io_trace UNIX: C Shell: setenv ING_SET \"set io_trace\" Bourne Shell: ING_SET = \"set io_trace\" export ING_SET VMS: DEFINE ING_SET \"SET IO_TRACE\" For example, given the query: select * from iirelation; Here is a sample output from the I/O trace. The counts are the number of pages read/written: *************************************************************** I/O READ File: aaaaaaac.t00 (iidbdb, iirel_idx, 13) count:1 *************************************************************** *************************************************************** I/O READ File: aaaaaaab.t00 (iidbdb, iirelation, 0) count:8 *************************************************************** *************************************************************** I/O READ File: aaaaaaab.t00 (iidbdb, iirelation, 8) count:8 *************************************************************** I/O READ File: aaaaaaab.t00 (iidbdb, iirelation, 16) count:7 Note: When tracing the I/O or the locks of a parallel query (using set io_trace or set lock_trace with set parallel n), the trace messages from child threads of the QEP are logged to the II_DBMS_LOG. The trace messages for the main thread are sent to the user session in the normal manner. Trace Utilities 216 System Administrator Guide Lock Tracing Set lock_trace prints out information about locks within a transaction. The following command turns lock tracing on as the default ING_SET level: Windows: set ING_SET=set lock_trace UNIX: C Shell: setenv ING_SET \"set lock_trace\" Bourne Shell: ING_SET = \"set lock_trace\"export ING_SET VMS: DEFINE ING_SET \"SET LOCK_TRACE\" Trace Utilities Using Monitoring and Tracing Tools 217 Event Tracing The following features enable your application to display and trace events:  To enable or disable the display of event trace information for an application when it raises an event, use the following command: set [no]printdbevents  To enable the display of events as they are raised by the application, specify set printdbevents. To disable the display of events, specify set noprintdbevents.  To enable or disable the logging of rais ed events to the installation log file, use the following statement: set [no]logdbevents  To enable the logging of events as they are raised by the application, specify set logdbevents. To disable the logging of events, specify set nologdbevents.  To enable or disable the display of events as they are received by an application, use the following statement: set_sql(dbeventdisplay = 1 | 0) Specify a value of 1 to enable the display of received events, or 0 to disable the display of received events. You can also enable this feature using II_EMBED_SET. You can create a routine that traps all events returned to an embedded SQL application. To enable/disable an event-handling routine or function, your embedded SQL application must issue the following set_sql statement: exec sql set_sql(dbeventhandler = event_routine | 0) To trap events to your event-handling routine, specify event_routine as a pointer to"

Trace Utilities 218 System Administrator Guide User-Server Communications The General Communication Facility (GCF) is composed of the GCA protocol and three communications programs: Name Server, Communications Server, and Data Access Server. These are separate processes. You can listen in on the communications between these GCF programs using the following Ingres environment variables and logicals:  II_EMBED_SET “printgca”  II_GCA_TRACE  II_GCN_TRACE  II_GCC_TRACE  II_GCD_TRACE  II_GC_TRACE  II_GCCCL_TRACE  II_GCA_LOG Trace Communication Using printgca You can trace communications occurring in the GCA with the following command: Windows: set II_EMBED_SET=printgca UNIX: C Shell: setenv II_EMBED_SET \"printgca\" Bourne Shell: II_EMBED_SET = \"printgca\" export II_EMBED_SET VMS: DEFINE II_EMBED_SET \"PRINTGCA\" This traces all GCA messages passed between Ingres tools and the server.

UNIX Trace Facilities Using Monitoring and Tracing Tools 221 Bourne Shell -x Option Invoking a Bourne shell with the -x option causes each shell command to be printed before it is executed. This is es pecially useful for diagnosing problems with installation shell scripts. To use this trace on the Ingres shutdown script, call the Bourne shell (or Korn shell) with the -x option, passing the name ingstop as the script to be executed: sh -x ingstop This option can only be used with UNIX shell scripts, not with binary executables. If you are in doubt as to whether a program or command is a binary or shell script, type: file program_name UNIX replies with “commands text,” “ASCII text,” or “executable shell script” if it is an executable shell script. Otherwise the file command returns a message specific to your machine—something like demand paged executable and possibly the designated chip on which it was compiled to run. UNIX Trace Command Some UNIX platforms (such as Sun) provide a facility to trace system calls as they are made by a process. To invoke it, enter trace at the operating system prompt. Create an Ingres Console for Error Monitoring in UNIX To ensure that any new errors written to the Ingres error log file are displayed on the terminal screen, issue the following command at the terminal. tail -f $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/errlog.log To continuously monitor the activities of the Ingres recovery process (dmfrcp), issue this command: tail -f $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/iircp.log"

To find out which UNIX platforms are supported, see the Ingres Corporation web site. Visual Manager Ingres Visual Manager (IVM) provides a global view into the Ingres installation. It serves as a system console from which you can manage Ingres components and access other utilities. This utility captures events that are occurring in the system and allows them to be filtered for emphasis, based on your preferences. IVM allows you to monitor (and start and stop) the different servers in the installation (DBMS, Name, Communications, JDBC, Data Access, Bridge, Star, ICE, and Recovery) as well as Remo te Command, the Logging and Locking systems, and the Primary Transaction Log and Archiver process. It shows events occurring in the system both at the installation level and the level of each server. Using IVM, you can also edit the Ingres system and user environment variable settings. Visual Manager 224 System Administrator Guide Functions of Visual Manager Ingres Visual Manager enables you to:  View the started and stopped components and servers in the installation as well as the history of start/stop events  Start or stop the entire installation or individual components  View and edit Ingres system and user environment variables  Control how various types of Ingres error log messages are handled  Set preferences for event monitoring and notification  View and filter events that occurred both at the installation level and the component or server level  View statistics on these events  View explanations for error log messages  Access all Ingres visual tools and online documentation Visual Manager Managing Your System and Monitoring Performance 225 Visual Manager Window The Ingres Visual Manager window contains a list of Ingres components. By selecting any branch of the corresponding tree, you can access information related to the branch, which correspond either to the entire Ingres installation (the root branch), an individual component configuration, or an individual instance of a given configuration. The Visual Manager Window contains the following tabs: Status Displays the summary of startup status of the components of the installation, the start and stop history of any component in the configuration, and related information such as the output of the last start or stop operation. Parameters Displays system, user, or extra parameters.

Visual Performance Monitor Managing Your System and Monitoring Performance 231 Visual Performance Monitor Visual Performance Monitor can be used as a monitoring tool, a performance analysis tool, and a system management tool. Visual Performance Monitor lets you monitor the following:  Servers You can view a list of the servers that are started on an Ingres installation, and information about each server. For example, you can view the sessions that are currently active for each server. You can also remove a session or stop a server (if you are a privileged user). Visual Performance Monitor provides the following information for a particular server: – Lock lists – Locks – Transactions – Locked databases, tables, and pages – Other locked resources – Network traffic for Net servers  Users and sessions You can monitor users for whom there are open sessions. You can find out which sessions are open for a particular user, and drill down further to reveal all the related information about those sessions (lock lists, transactions locked, databases locked, and so on).  Logging You can view logging system summaries, transaction lists, process, and database lists. Log information can be used to monitor transaction rates, log file activity, processes, and databases in the logging system. This information is useful in determining which logging parameters need to be adjusted.  Locking You can monitor lock information to help determine which lock parameters need to be adjusted. Viewing locking system summaries, lock lists, and resources provides you with the information you need to spot conditions when, for example, additional locking system resources need to be added. Viewing your lock lists is useful for locating transactions that cannot proceed because they are blocked by another transaction. Visual Performance Monitor 232 System Administrator Guide  System performance You can view your performance information from a “database” point of view. This means you can access performance information using a database branch, as opposed to the root branches of Visual Performance Monitor.  Replication You can start, stop, and monitor Replicator servers that are required for the replication scheme that has been defined in a VDBA DOM window. You can set up startup parameters for these servers, send events to these servers, view and manage collisions, and display other miscellaneous replication monitor information. Visual Performance Monitor lets you perform the following actions:  Refresh data in the window from a server  Shut down a database server or close a session Visual Performance Monitor Window The Visual Performance Monitor window contains a list of categories under which various types of Ingres performance information appears. Under each root object category are branches representing each performance entity. Under each branch are one or more sub-branches that pertain to the particular type of performance entity. For more information, see the Visual Performance Monitor online help. For context-sensitive help on any active dialog or window, press F1. Visual Configuration Differences Analyzer Managing Your System and Monitoring Performance 233 Visual Configuration Differences Analyzer The Visual Configuration Differences An alyzer (VCDA) allows you to compare the configurations for an Ingres local installation by taking “snapshots” of its configuration. For example, after you install Ingres and have set up the database schemas, take a snapshot of the configuration. If you encounter problems later on, take another snapshot of the configuration and compare it to the earlier snapshot to see if any configuration changes have contributed to the problem. Keep an on-going record of configuration changes by starting with a snapshot of a new installation that shows all system defaults, and taking a snapshot of the installation each time the configuration is changed. Note: VCDA compares the configurations of Ingres installations, but not the database object definitions within these installations. To compare database objects, see the Visual Database Object s Differences Analyzer (VDDA), in the Database Administrator Guide and the Ingres online help. Specifically, VCDA allows you to:  Save a snapshot of the current configuration into a file  Compare two saved snapshot files, or the current installation with a saved snapshot  Restore selective groups of configuration"

Specifically, VCDA allows you to:  Save a snapshot of the current configuration into a file  Compare two saved snapshot files, or the current installation with a saved snapshot  Restore selective groups of configuration parameters from a saved snapshot For specific instructions on performing these tasks, refer to the VCDA online help. Configuration Snapshot File When you take a snapshot of the current configuration for the local installation, VCDA writes the following information to a text file:  Main Parameters: The value of II_SYSTEM, II_CLUSTER, II_CONFIG_LOCAL, II_NETBIOS_NAME, hostname, and username  All information included in the config.dat file, and in the additional config.dat files pointed to by II_CONFIG_LOCAL (if any)  All vnode information, except for password data  All Ingres system variables  All Ingres user variables This snapshot can be compared to other snapshots as explained below. Visual Configuration Differences Analyzer 234 System Administrator Guide Comparison of Configuration Snapshots VCDA allows you to compare the current configuration of the local installation with a previously saved configuration snapshot. It also allows you to compare two saved snapshots that do not include the current configuration. VCDA also indicates, using an icon color, if the difference is due to a parameter that is different in both snapshots, or a parame ter that exists in one snapshot but not in the other. If there are no differences in the main parameters, VCDA displays a green icon and a message. If there are no differenc es in the other information, VCDA displays only a green icon. Comparison of Remote Installation Snapshots Although you can only take snapshots of the local installation, you can compare configurations on remote installations (even on different platforms) by making the snapshot file from on e machine available to another machine that is running VCDA. The snapshot file is a simple text file that is readable across different platforms. Restoration of Configuration Parameters Through VCDA In addition to comparing configuration snapshots, VCDA allows you to restore selected groups of configuration parameters from a saved snapshot. The only parameters that VCDA does not restore are the values of II_SYSTEM, the hostname and username. You restore parameters by first selecting the snapshot file that contains the desired parameters. You can specify the specific parameters you want to restore. If the snapshot file you choose corresponds to a networked installation, you can also specify the value of the corresponding Ingres variables and the content of the relevant additional config.dat file, with an option to create the tree structure if it does not exist. VCDA automatically creates a backup snap shot file of the current configuration before it restores parameters. If for so me reason you do not want to keep the restored parameters, you can select this backup snapshot file to restore the parameters to their previous state. Visual Configuration Differences Analyzer Managing Your System and Monitoring Performance 235 How VCDA Handles Concatenated config.dat Files VCDA uses information from the config.dat file, which normally contains parameters that apply to the local hostname only. However, if you want to concatenate the contents of all your config.dat files into a single config.dat file to distribute across multiple environments, VCDA manages this situation as follows:  The hostname under which a snapshot is saved shall be saved within the snapshot.  If VCDA detects that hostnames other than the snapshot one are managed within the config.dat information of the snapshot, VCDA shall display it. A “hostname mapping” option is available in that situation, so that VCDA can compare the additional hostnames configuration parameters. If this option is not used, the parameters are compared including their “hostname” part, (that is, only parameters that are identical for the same hostname within the two snapshots are considered as identical). Analyzing and Recovering Journaled Transactions 237 Chapter 9: Analyzing and Recovering Journaled Transactions This chapter discusses journaled transactions and how to analyze, recover, and redo them using the Journal Analyzer visual tool. Journal Analyzer The Journal Analyzer utility allows you to view and analyze journaled transactions and individual underlying statements. It also enables you to create SQL scripts, which are used to recover or redo individual row operations without redoing or rolling back the whole database or table.

Start Journal Analyzer 238 System Administrator Guide Start Journal Analyzer To start the Journal Analyzer: Windows: Do one of the following:  Click Start on the taskbar and choose Programs, Ingres, Ingres Journal Analyzer.  From within Ingres Visual Manager's right-click popup menu, select Journal Analyzer, or click the Journal Analyzer toolbar button.  Type ija at the command prompt. UNIX:  Type ija at the command prompt. Journal Analyzer Window In the Journal Analyzer window, the left pane consists of the vnode, databases, and tables. In the left pane, you can drill down to the desired vnode, database, and (optionally) table. When a database or table has been selected, the right pane appears as follows: Transaction Views Analyzing and Recovering Journaled Transactions 239 Controls in the right pane are as follows: Filter Use the Filter options to control the quantity and type of transactions that are displayed, based on different criteria such as the transaction date and time, checkpoint number, user, and so on. View Clicking the View button displays transaction information that is currently in the journals. You must click the View button to refresh the data when you change the filter criteria. Move Logs to Journals To see any recent transactions that are in the transaction log file—but have not yet moved to the journals—click Move Log to Journals. Transaction Views Based on whether you select a database or table in the navigational pane of the Journal Analyzer, and whether the Group by Transaction option is selected, you see a slightly different interface in the right pane. Database Level Journaled Transactions When you select a database, you see the journaled transactions within the database that match the criteria defined in the top of the pane. You can then determine whether you want to group transactions and view the details for only selected transactions. Transaction Views 240 System Administrator Guide Group Changes by Transaction When the Group by Transaction option is selected, a single line of “summary” information is displayed for each transaction in the uppermost list, sorted by transaction number. When one or more of these lines are selected, the detailed information for all selected lines is shown in the lower list. The detail information corresponds to each row of journaled tables altered in the transaction(s), in addition to statements such as create table or alter table that were executed within the transaction. For example, in the following window, a transaction is selected and the corresponding detail lines are displayed beneath it: Although the rows are sorted by transaction number initially, look at (and sort by) transaction end (End column), because it is the time when all changes for the transaction become available to other users. A transaction with a higher number (that is, having started later) than another transaction, can be committed first, in which case the underlying changes become available to other users before those of the other transaction (which had a smaller number because it had started first). For this reason, sort on transaction end (by clicking on the corresponding header). Transaction Views Analyzing and Recovering Journaled Transactions 241 View Transaction Details If the Group by Transaction option is not selected, a single list appears, displaying all the individual actions for each transaction, in transaction order: Even these detail lines provide a summary of information on the individual actions.

This list cannot display column names because different tables have different column names. To get the full detail of individual rows that have changed, you must choose a table in the navigational pane. See Table Level Journaled Transactions (see page 242). For update statements, the “before update” and “after update” images are shown. For inserts and deletes, only one row (the inserted or deleted one) appears. Different colored rows are used to denote the type of statement (in addition to the Action column that displays strings such as begin, end, insert, update, delete, and so on). An icon preceding each line shows you whether the transaction it belongs to was committed or rolled backed, included a partial rollback, or involved changes in non-journaled tables (an exclamation point next to the icon appears in this case). You can sort the data by any criteria by simply clicking on the corresponding column header. Transaction Views 242 System Administrator Guide Table Level Journaled Transactions On the table level, the right pane looks and functions similar to the one at the database level, but only the row changes corresponding to the selected table appear. There is no Group by Transaction check box for the table level. At the table level, you can view a history of journaled changes in that table. As opposed to the database level panes, where more than one table was involved, it is possible here to have the real column names become headers of the results list, which was not possible at the database level because the columns are normally different in each table that was involved in the transaction. You can also sort the data on the table level by clicking on a column header. In particular, the following sorts are useful:  Commit date—this is the most meaningful criteria for sorting the changes  Transaction number—be aware that the transactions are not always committed in the same order  LSN—shows you the exact sequence of row changes For more information on the interface for this utility, see the Journal Analyzer online help topics. Transaction Views Analyzing and Recovering Journaled Transactions 243 Select Transactions and Row Changes After browsing for the transactions or row changes that you want to recover or redo, you can select one or more transactions or individual row changes. If the Group by Transaction check box is selected, and multiple transaction lines are selected, the detail list shows the row changes corresponding to all selected transactions. If this option is not selected, you are selecting lines at the table level, which correspond to row changes, not full transactions. The Recover and Redo dialogs proposes (but does not pre-select) the other changes in those transactions of the initial row changes that were selected. Tip: Select whole transactions associated with the changes to be recovered to ensure transaction integrity. This is the preferred and most common way to recover row changes. After making your selections, the Recover and Redo buttons are available. If you do select lines corresponding to only part of a transaction, there are other factors to consider, as described in Recover Transactions or Individual Row Changes (see page 244) and Redo Transactions and Individual Row Changes Option (see page 251). The Select All button allows you to select all transactions currently displayed in the pane for the selected criteria. This can be useful for example for replaying whole portions of journals on another node/database, through the Redo functionality described in the Redo Tr ansactions or Individual Row Changes (see page 251). Recover Transactions or Individual Row Changes 244 System Administrator Guide Recover Transactions or Individual Row Changes The Recover dialog is used to create one of two types of “undo scripts”—an internal script that is run immediately or an external script that can be saved and run later. To recover transactions, follow these steps: 1. When you click Recover, the Reco ver dialog appears as follows: Initially, the row changes that you selected in the Journal Analyzer are displayed in the lower portion of the Recover dialog. 2. Click \"Recover Now\" to recover immediately, or \"Generate External Scripts\" to generate scripts that can be run later, as described in Recover Immediately or Generate External Scripts Option (see page 249).

Recover Transactions or Individual Row Changes Analyzing and Recovering Journaled Transactions 245 Recover “Whole” Transactions or Individual Rows If you chose whole transactions in the Journal Analyzer, the Whole Transaction(s) option is selected automatically in the Recover dialog. If you selected individual row changes that make up only part of a transaction (in the lower portion of the dialog), the Individual Rows option is selected. In this case, you are prompted for confirmation as to whether you want to recover only parts of transactions, and lose transaction integrity. Although the recovery of individual rows is not recommended, it can be useful, for example, if a table has Ingres rules associated with it. Rules, Constraints, and Integrities If a table has Ingres rules associated with it that results in additional row changes within the same transaction, do not generate undo operations for such dependent changes because it leads to undesirable results. Also, the rules can change between the time of the initial transaction and the time when you want to undo that transaction. Instead, undo only the change in the base table, and let the rules generate the dependent changes. Journal Analyzer detects the rules, constraints, and integrities that exist in the tables involved in the transaction(s) and displays them on the tabbed pages in the Recover dialog. From this display, you can determine whether some changes in a transaction resulted from rules and if certain constraints cannot be fulfilled. This information helps you determine if you want to use the No Rules option, and possibly disable certain rows within the transaction. You can view the properties for a particular rule, constraint, or integrity by double clicking it. Examine these entities to determine their impact on a restore. Note: Integrity constraints that are violated are not specifically reported: updates and inserts that violate any integrity constraints are simply not performed. Recover Transactions or Individual Row Changes 246 System Administrator Guide Scan Journals to End Option The Scan Journals to the End option provides a warning if the tables have been altered since the time of the initial transaction, in which case the rules for these tables have changed. If there are rules on a table, you have two choices:  Disable individual row changes in the undo scripts, by deselecting the corresponding row changes in the Recover dialog. This can be useful, for example, if the current rules cause the desired operation in dependent tables, in which case you must disable the dependent row changes.  Use the No Rules option to allow you to disable rules while executing the queries. This option allows the reversal of the exact row changes of the initial transaction, regardless of what the rules were at that time, and what they are now. The side effect of this option is that if there are constraints on the corresponding tables , they are not checked if this option is used . This operation must be used very carefully. If the Journal Analyzer previously detected current constraints on those tables, it provides a warning and asks for confirmation before starting the operation. Order of Transactions and Statements in Transactions The order of the undoing of transactions is reverse of the order at commit time of these transactions and cannot be changed. If for some reason you need the order to be different than the usual order, the only way to do this is to recover each transaction separately (by launching the Recover dialog for each transaction individually) in the desired order. In each transaction to be recovered, the order of the individual statements can be changed, using the Up and Down buttons in the Recover dialog. Recover Transactions or Individual Row Changes Analyzing and Recovering Journaled Transactions 247 How to Check If Rows Have Changed After the Transaction Before proposing to reverse row changes resulting from a transaction, you must take into account the fact that some of these rows have changed after the transaction. The possible cases are as follows:  None of these rows have changed and there is no problem. Or:  If a row has changed, usually no row corresponding to the “after image” of the initial change can be found, and therefore the “reverse” statement, which includes a where clause that searches for a row"

Or:  If a row has changed, usually no row corresponding to the “after image” of the initial change can be found, and therefore the “reverse” statement, which includes a where clause that searches for a row corresponding to such “after image,” fails because no such row is found. There is an “advanced” exception, in the case where a given row (the same or another one) has the exact same content afterwards as the after image of the initial change: in this case, it is the user’s responsibility to make a decision about taking additional actions. For this reason, the following features are available:  The changes that you have asked to re verse are displayed in the dialog for you to view.  By default, the Scan Journals to the En d option is selected. It indicates if later changes affected the rows involved in the transaction. If this problem is not an issue, disable the option.  If rows of the transaction to be undone have changed since the transaction, Journal Analyzer prompts you with a warning, asking whether you want to continue. Recover Transactions or Individual Row Changes 248 System Administrator Guide Users of Transactions By default, Journal Analyzer proposes to recover transactions by executing reverse transactions under the currently connected user. However, the Impersonate User of Initial Transaction option allows you to impersonate the user under which each transaction had initially been executed. Note: This option requires that the connected user is the database administrator or has appropriate privileges. The Impersonate User of Initial Transaction option affects the way the reverse transactions are executed: that is, normally Journal Analyzer recovers multiple transactions by executing the recover statements of all transactions to be undone in a single, global “recover” transaction. This allows, in case of failure at any point in the recover operation, to cancel the whole operation. However, given that it is not possible to execute in the same transaction different statements under different users, if this option is used, and the initial transactions had not all be executed under the same user, Journal Analyzer must commit (and change the user) before each reverse statement to be executed under a different user than the previous one. A possible problem in this case is when a reverse statement fails, once other recover statements have already been committed. In this situation, Journal Analyzer proposes to “undo the undo” of the transactions previously undone. However in case of failure of this last operation, you need to manually “repair” this situation (typically by using Journal Analyzer) by completing or canceling the uncompleted operation. Recover Transactions or Individual Row Changes Analyzing and Recovering Journaled Transactions 249 Number of Rows Affected by Each Individual “Reverse Statement” Journal Analyzer-generated reverse statements for insert and update statements are delete and update statements, with a “where” clause on all columns that can be accepted in a where clause (column types such as “long varchar” cannot). If you need two identical rows in which all columns can be part of a where clause (SQL does not normally distinguished such rows), the Recover dialog has an option (selected by default) called “Don’t Recover if >1 Row is Affected by an Individual Statement”. Only when th is option is explicitly disabled does the recover process work even if more than one row is affected by an individual recover statement. In the case where no row is affected by an individual “recover” statement, Journal Analyzer provides an error anyway, and the recover operation fails. If the Scan Journals to End option has not been disabled, Journal Analyzer normally warns you that rows involved already have changed since the initial transaction (different warnings appear if journaling has been disabled after the initial transaction or in similar situations). Recover Immediately or Generate External Scripts Option If you want to view the script that is run based on your Recover dialog selections, click the View Recover Script Now button. The following dialog appears: Recover Transactions or Individual Row Changes 250 System Administrator Guide This dialog allows you to see the SQL statements that are executed if you click the Recover Now button.

In this case:  There is an error message if some da ta types included in rows of the transaction cannot be inserted in the script  The user must be aware of the context of possible rules and constraints existing on the target database at the time when the script is executed and accordingly update the script. Redo Transactions and Individual Row Changes Analyzing and Recovering Journaled Transactions 251 Redo Transactions and Individual Row Changes From the Journal Analyzer window, you can also launch the Redo dialog, as follows: This dialog is useful for the following purposes:  For redoing rolled back transactions (that had been rolled back for an unwanted reason for example)  For regenerating similar, committed transactions in another database This dialog is similar to the Recover dialog; however, two additional controls allow you to specify a different node and database where to redo the transaction or statement. All the features described in the Recovering Transactions section for the Recover dialog apply to this dialog and function in the same way—only for redoing transactions. For more information, see that section and the help system. Understanding Ingres Management Architecture 253 Chapter 10: Understanding Ingres Management Architecture This chapter describes the overall features of Ingres Management Architecture (IMA), shows examples of how it is used from SQL, and notes restrictions that application developers should know about. Ingres Management Architecture (IMA) The Ingres Management Architecture (IMA) provides the framework to access system data for monitoring and managing installations: Monitoring The monitoring facilities include the system data currently reported through specialized utilities such as the Ingres Visual Manager, Visual Performance Monitor, Interactive Performance Monitor (ipm), lockstat, logstat, and iimonitor. Managing Active management operations include stopping servers and manipulating sessions in DBMS and Star servers. With IMA you can create system management applications using standard SQL tools. With Ingres Net, the IMA provides access to multiple installations, allowing management of complex environments with a single SQL application. The IMA is also designed to be compatible with standard management protocols, such as SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), DME (Distributed Management Environment), and CMIP (Common Management Interface Protocol). IMA provides its services without affecting the underlying operation of the product. IMA Audience 254 System Administrator Guide IMA Audience IMA provides the means of creating sophisticated DBMS management applications for users and third-party vendors. These capabilities are of interest to advanced DBAs, system administrators, and developers producing tools for use by DBAs and system administrators. The user of this product must be famili ar with Ingres tools such as OpenROAD, Ingres Terminal Monitor, and VDBA and have an overall understanding of system monitoring capacities and purposes. IMA Architecture With IMA, all the installations in an administrative domain can be managed by a collection of pure SQL applications that can be written mainly with OpenROAD:  OpenROADApplication —the monitoring program written in standard SQL.  Tables in DBMS —catalog tables representing the run state of various servers and global parameters from all of the installations of interest.  IMA—provides access to objects defined in the DBMS Server and in other processes.  Server Processes —the DBMS Server and other processes being monitored. With Ingres Net, these can be on different vnode installations. Management Information Base Understanding Ingres Management Architecture 255 The following illustration shows the IMA gateway and its connection to an OpenROAD application: Management Information Base The data in the Management Information Base catalog tables form a Management Information Base (MIB)."

Management Information Base Understanding Ingres Management Architecture 255 The following illustration shows the IMA gateway and its connection to an OpenROAD application: Management Information Base The data in the Management Information Base catalog tables form a Management Information Base (MIB). The available data is defined using a simple object model. The MIB is made visible to management applications through the IMA facility, which provides SQL access to the data in the MIB. Management Information Base 256 System Administrator Guide Data and the Object Model The MIB is defined as an abstract entity consisting of simply typed management objects: Simply Typed Simply Typed means that objects have values that are strings or strings that can be interpreted as integers, and do not represent aggregates, such as structures. Aggregate Objects Aggregate objects, such as a C language structure, are represented in the MIB by having a separate object type for each element. (This can be compared to having a single table for each potential column in a relational database, with the entire table made visible with a join of all the column tables.) In the model each object has a name ( classid ), location, and one or more instances. Classid Each data object in the MIB has a name, called the classid , which defines its type and semantics. Classids are strings that form a hierarchical name space by the convention of using periods (.) to separate levels of the tree. For example, consider the following classid: exp.scf.scs.scb_query This object name identifies an experimental object, owned by scf, that is scs related, and that is the scb_query. In the current release all objects are under the exp experimental branch of the name space tree. Management Information Base Understanding Ingres Management Architecture 257 Location of Data Objects Each data object is located in some place. If it is:  Process-specific, the place is a particular server  Visible in several different processes in an installation, its place is the vnode in which the installation is located The place must be local, or remotely accessed using Ingres Net. Installation passwords must be working. The general format of the place string is: [vnode ::] [/@iigcn | /@ gca_address ] where: gca_address is the listen address of the server as shown in Configuration Manager (vcbf), Interactive Performance Monitor (ipm) or Name Server Maintenance Utility (iinamu). Number of Instances of a Classid None, one, or more objects of a particular classid can exist in a process or a vnode. Each has a corresponding instance value. This value is always a string, although it is possible in many instances to interpret the string as an integer value. A table is modeled by having objects wi th instance values that form a key index. Data Keys All data objects in the MIB have simple data types, can have many different instances, and are located either in a server process or in a vnode. Thus, they are always addressed with a three-part key: { [vnode_or_server ,] classid , instance } Components of the IMA 258 System Administrator Guide Components of the IMA This following is a reference model for the IMA. The components of the model are described below, with the current IMA implementation noted: User Protocol The User Protocol is forms or other appropriate interface. A Management Application program provides the user protocol. MIB Server The application obtains MIB data through an Application Management Protocol , such as SQL (or alternative protocol such as SNMP). The current IMA implementation is SQL-based.  A MIB Server process accepts the application management protocol.  The MIB server communicates with the managed processes by an Underlying Management Protocol . Components of the IMA Understanding Ingres Management Architecture 259 Thus, managed processes need to talk to only a single protocol, while MIB servers can be provided to support management applications using a variety of protocols. IMA Management Protocol The IMA defines its own underlying management protocol for use between servers. The IMA protocol is built on top of the regular GCA protocol. Ingres Net provides IMA management of other installations transparently. IMA Server The IMA Server maintains the SQL MIB data. It uses a non-relational gateway to present the management objects in the domain as SQL tables:  For objects internal to the DBMS Serv er, the IMA Server reads and writes objects directly.  Operations on objects that are in other processes are handled using the GCA management protocol.

Without an Ingres DBMS Server, no management data is available to non-privileged users. It is possible for privileged applications to communicate with servers using the GCM directly. The architecture permits Enterprise Access products from other management protocols to be written using either SQL or the underlying GCA management protocol directly. SQL MIB Creation The IMA’s SQL MIB is the binding of the MIB object space into an SQL name space. Tables containing MIB objects can be registered into any database owned by the $ingres user. The binding itself is done by the IMA, which converts between rows and individual MIB objects. IMA Tables Registration IMA tables must be added explicitly by the $ingres user in any database owned by $ingres to define an SQL schema for a MIB database. The SQL register table as import statement is used to register IMA tables. IMA registered tables can be opened only in databases owned by $ingres. IMA catalogs must be created, if they do not already exist. Only the iidbdb has these catalogs. SQL MIB Creation Understanding Ingres Management Architecture 261 Register Table Statement The register table as import st atement has the following syntax: register table tablename (col_name format [is ' ext_format '] {, col_name format [is ' ext_format ']}) as import from ' source' with dbms = ima [, structure = none | [unique] sortkeyed] [, key = ( col_name [asc] {, col_name})] [, rows = nnnnnnnn] [, [no]duplicates] [, [no]update] [, [no]journaling] ; where: tablename Is the name of the table. This must follow the standard naming conventions. This is a required parameter. col_name Is the name of the column. This must follow the standard naming conventions. This is a required parameter. format Is the data type of the column. This is a required parameter. is 'ext_format' Specifies the management object bein g referenced, by extended format string name. This is either:  Classid: A reserved name identifying metadata:  PLACE: Column is any kind of place, char type.  VNODE: Column is vnode places only char type.  SERVER: Column is server places only char type.  CLASSID: Column is the classid name char type.  INSTANCE: Column is the instance value char type.  VALUE: Column is the char value of the {place, classid, instance} object.  PERMISSIONS: Column is the integer management object permission mask for the classid. as import Indicates that you are registering a gateway product.

IMA Table Types There are two types of IMA tables:  Flat object Tables  Cross Tab Tables SQL MIB Creation Understanding Ingres Management Architecture 263 Flat Tables Flat tables have one object instance pe r row. Only flat object tables can be updated. This is a sample flat object table: server classid instance value here::@/1001 exp.table.index 01 01 here::@/1001 exp.table.index 02 02 here::@/1001 exp.table.user 01 gammerl here::@/1001 exp.table.user 02 dommage here::@/1001 exp.table.value 01 88 here::@/1001 exp.table.value 01 99 Flat tables must be registered as in the following example: register table ima_mib_objects ( server varchar(64) not null not default is 'SERVER', classid varchar(64) not null not default is 'CLASSID', instance varchar(64) not null not default is 'INSTANCE',value varchar(64) not null not default is 'VALUE', perms integer2 not null not default is 'PERMISSIONS' ) as import from 'objects' with update, dbms = IMA, structure = unique sortkeyed, key = (server, classid, instance); Cross-tab Tables Cross-tab tables have one object per column, per row. A cross-tab version of the same data as above is much more convenient to query, as shown below: index user value 01 gammerl 88 02 dommage 99 SQL MIB Creation 264 System Administrator Guide A cross-tab table has 1… n columns, including at least one that is the index. A place column is optional. If present, it is identified by having an “is clause” of VNODE or SERVER. If it is omitted, the place defaults to the current server. All other columns are assumed to be management object classids, sharing common index instance values. Cross-tab tables must be registered in the following format. The columns in the registration can be in any order, but must be sortkeyed on the place, if it is present, and the index object. Here is an example of IMA cross-tab table registration syntax: register table ima_dbms_servers ( server varchar(64) not null not default is 'SERVER', listen_address varchar(64) not null not default is 'exp.gcf.gca.client.listen_address', max_connections integer4 not null not default is 'exp.scf.scd.server.max_connections', num_connections integer4 not null not default is 'exp.scf.scd.server.current_connections', server_pid integer4 not null not default is 'exp.clf .unix .cs.srv_block.pid') as import from 'tables' with dbms = IMA, structure = sortkeyed, key = (server); Register Table Examples The subsections below give examples of table registrations for the IMA MIB. These tables are used in Query Examples to IMA Tables in this chapter that show examples of SQL access to IMA. The objects and contents of all registered tables are subject to enforcement of appropriate access restrictions. SQL MIB Creation Understanding Ingres Management Architecture 265 Example: Flat Object Table A flat object table is required to be ab le to update any object. Objects that can be updated are control objects. register table ima_objects ( server varchar(64) not null not default is ‘SERVER’, classid varchar(64) not null not default is ‘CLASSID’, instance varchar(64) not null not default is ‘INSTANCE’, value varchar(64) not null not default is ‘VALUE’ ) as import from ‘objects’ with dbms = IMA, update, structure = unique sortkeyed, key = (server, classid, instance); Example: Object Metadata Table This table provides metadata about the known objects in the domain. Objects appear to be supported by many servers: register table ima_meta ( server varchar(64) not null not default is ‘SERVER’, classid varchar(64) not null not default is ‘exp.glf.mo.meta.classid’, class varchar(64) not null not default is ‘exp.glf.mo.meta.class’, perms i2 not null not default is ‘exp.glf.mo.meta.perms’, size i2 not null not default is ‘exp.glf.mo.meta.size’, xindex varchar(64) not null not default is ‘exp.glf.mo.meta.index’ ) as import from ‘tables’ with dbms = IMA, structure = unique sortkeyed, key = (server, classid); SQL MIB Creation 266 System Administrator Guide Examples: Domain Tables This table shows the domain of servers and vnodes visible to the session: register table ima_session_domain ( domplace varchar(64) not null not default is ‘exp.gwf.gwm.session.dom.index’ ) as import from ‘tables’ with"

This statement removes all catalog entries for the registered table, including any related views, integrities, and permits. This statement has the following syntax: remove table tablename ; where: tablename Is the table name for a registered IMA file. SQL Management Domains A management domain consists of the objects in the servers and installations visible to an SQL application through the DBMS Enterprise Access. This domain is session-specific. The domain is initially defined through a table registration, as described in Examples: Domain Tables (see page 266). Update queries can add or delete vnodes or servers to or from the domain. Each vnode or server in the domain must be directly reachable through Ingres Net by the $ingres user in the vnode processing the query. Control Objects The MIB defines control objects that can be updated, using the SQL update statement, to produce known effects. The only rows that exist are those objects defined in the MIB, in a flat object table (see page 265). They cannot be created or deleted through direct SQL manipulation. Because SQL is providing a view of an abstract MIB, the tables are not granted permissions for inserts and deletes. For example, to add a new write-behind thread, update the “number of write- behind threads” object, rather than inserting a new row in a table of write- behind threads. Updating the “number of write-behind threads” object adds new objects that are related to the new thread. IMA Dbmsinfo Constants Understanding Ingres Management Architecture 273 IMA Dbmsinfo Constants There are three new dbmsinfo constants available for use in queries involving IMA tables. Dbmsinfo is a function that returns a string containing information about the current session. This statement has the following syntax: dbmsinfo(' request_name ') where: request_name refers to one of those listed in the following table: Request Name Response Description ima_server Returns the IMA current server ima_session Returns the IMA current session ima_vnode Returns the IMA current vnode For further information about using dbmsinfo, see the SQL Reference Guide. Query Examples to IMA Tables The following sections provide examples of possible queries to IMA tables, based on the table registrations in the previous sections. Note: Your actual queries must be based on the IMA models supplied on line.

The following query adds all the servers in this vnode, expanding from the default of only this DBMS Server: update ima_objects set value = dbmsinfo(‘ima_vnode’) where classid = ‘exp.gwf.gwm.session.control.add_vnode’ and instance = ‘0’ and server = dbmsinfo(‘ima_server’); The ‘exp.gwf.gwm.session.control.del_vnode’ object can be used to delete rows, and an update with any value to the ‘exp.gwf.gwm.session.control.reset_domain’ object removes all the rows in the domain. Example: What Are User Sessions Doing? The following query shows what user sessions are currently doing in all servers in the domain: select * from ima_server_sessions where db_owner != ‘’; This query includes sessions on other nodes of a cluster in a cluster installation. Query Examples to IMA Tables Understanding Ingres Management Architecture 275 Example: Who Is Waiting for a Lock? The following query shows which sessions are waiting for locks: select distinct resource_id_id, lock_id_id, lock_state, ima_locklists.locklist_id_id, locklist_server_pid, locklist_session_id, effective_user, db_name, session_terminal, session_query from ima_locks, ima_locklists, ima_server_sessions where lock_state != 'GRANTED' and ima_locks.locklist_id_id = ima_locklists.locklist_id_id and ima_locklists.locklist_server_pid = ima_server_sessions.server_pid and ima_locklists.locklist_session_id = ima_server_sessions.session_id; Example: Who Holds Locks?

However, operations to other vnodes are notably slower. This monitoring leads to the conclusion that queries involving scans, especially remote scans, must be avoided whenever possible. In particular, an update operation must always be done with a fu lly qualified server key or it scans the object space in the domain, which can be noticeably slow. Restrictions IMA Use Following is a summary of restrictions on IMA use for the current release:  Support for data types is limited in table registrations. – Only integer types, varchar, and char can be specified as data types in the register table statement. – All columns must be not null not default.  The IMA supports full SQL but with the following current restrictions: – There are no transactions (as there is no locking or lock ownership of the underlying objects). Updates take immediate action and cannot be rolled back. – All reads are “dirty.” This means th at querying the same record can return different (inconsistent) values as the data underlying the record are changed. You are not guaranteed to get consistent results if you select the same object repeatedly. – Rule triggering is unreliable. Rules are not triggered"

Configuring the High Availability Option for Sun 279 Appendix A: Configuring the High Availability Option for Sun This appendix describes how to install and configure the Ingres High Availability Option in Sun cluster environments. The information in this appendix is intended for engineers with extensive knowledge of software and hardware in the cluster environment, including cluster concepts such as high availability (HA), global file systems, the resource management object model, resource properties, logical host names, shared addresses, failover, and switchover. Note: This appendix refers to specific Sun Cluster administration commands. For additional information about these commands, consult your Sun Cluster documentation. Failover Failover is the process by which a cluster automatically relocates a data service from a failed primary node to a designated secondary node. If a failover occurs, a brief interruption in service can occur, requiring you to reconnect after the failover has completed. Once reconnected, the physical server on which Ingres is running is transparent to the end user. The automatic failover feature ensures that transactions are handled by an active node in the cluster if a hardware or software failure occurs. Note: Any transactions that are in flight at the time of failure are lost. Ingres High Availability Option The Ingres High Availability Option for clusters runs application instances only on a single node. Depending on how the data service has been configured, when the fault monitor detects an error, it either attempts to restart the instance on the same node or to start the instance on another node for failover. Note: The Ingres High Availability Option is not scalable; that is, it does not provide active instances on multiple nodes. Configuration Guidelines for System and Data Files 280 System Administrator Guide Configuration Guidelines for System and Data Files Ingres system files can exist on either the local disks of each cluster node or on the cluster file system. Ingres data and related files must exist on the shared cluster file system. It is recommend that all system, data, and data related files be stored in the cluster file system. Cluster File Systems Access to Ingres data does not depend on the type of cluster file system. The cluster file systems must be configured with either Solstice DiskSuite or the VERITAS Volume Manager. For instructions on creating a global disk group, see the Sun DiskSuite documentation or the VERITAS Volume Manager documentation. Register the disk group with the cluster using the Sun Cluster administration command scconf. Configure the disk group as a SUNW.HAStorage Resource Type. This synchronizes actions between HA storage and Ingres High Availability Option. For more information, see the SUNW.HAStorage(5) man page. DBMS Server Requirements When using the Ingres High Availability Option, the Ingres DBMS server is installed and configured as a typical installation, provided that the database-related files are installed on the cluster file system. At the time of installation, the installer checks if the database, checkpoint, journal, dump, work, and transaction log files are on cluster drives. For a clustered DBMS installation, the database, checkpoint, journal, dump, work, and transaction log files must be on a cluster drive. The II_SYSTEM (Ingres home directory) must be installed on a non-cluster local drive. This configuration should be done while at the Ingres DBMS Configuration screen during installation. Note: An error message is displayed if the installer finds that the database files are not on a cluster drive. Using a logical hostname simplifies the installation and configuration of the Ingres DBMS Server in the cluster environment. Conversely, each node can be independently configured.

Using a logical hostname simplifies the installation and configuration of the Ingres DBMS Server in the cluster environment. Conversely, each node can be independently configured. Sun Cluster Software Installation Verification Configuring the High Availability Option for Sun 281 Set Up a Logical Hostname To set up a logical hostname, follow these steps: 1. Run the script iisuscha. Answer yes to “configure a logical hostname” and enter the logical hostname to be used in the HA cluster. This changes the congfig.dat file by replacing the server name with the logical hostname and sets II_HOSTNAME to the logical hostname. 2. Use this same logical host name when registering the HA option with the Sun cluster. Configure Independent Node If the variable II_HOSTNAME is not to be used for a logical hostname, each host configuration must be set up in the config.dat file. The first host on which Ingres is installed does not need additional setup. To add additional hostnames that can be used in the cluster, run the script iisuscha. Answer no to “configure a logical hostname.” Answer yes to “add a HA host” and enter the additional host to be added. This duplicates the entries in config.dat to match the primary server configuration settings. Each node then has a different DBMS server configuration, which is helpful in an unbalanced cluster. Each time a change is made to the Ingres configuration, the same change must be completed on each individual node. Sun Cluster Software Installation Verification The Sun Cluster packages must be installed and configured on the cluster nodes before installing the Ingres High Availability Option. The installation must be verified by a qualified Sun Cluster Engineer using the commands shown in the following table: Command Description scinstall –pv Displays the Sun cluster release and version information. scrgadm –p Displays the Sun cluster configured resource types, resource groups, and resources. scstat –p Displays the status of the Sun cluster components. scconf –p Displays the cluster configuration. Where to Install High Availability Option 282 System Administrator Guide Where to Install High Availability Option The Ingres High Availability Option must be installed on all nodes in the cluster where the Ingres DBMS Server can failover. Resource Registration Once the data service is installed on all nodes in the cluster, the resource must be registered. All administration must be done as a super user, normally the “root” user. During the installation of the Ingres High Availability Option, the resource type (Ingres.ingres_server) for the data service is automatically registered. Register the Ingres High Availability Option Resource If the resource type is not registered, use the following command to register it: # scrgadm –a –t Ingres.ingres_server –f /opt/Ingres/IngresSCAgent/etc/Ingres.ingres_server where: -t Specifies the predefined resource type name for the Ingres.ingres_server DBMS High Availability Option -f Specifies the pathname of the resource type registration file and is required if the file is not in the well-known directory(usually /usr/cluster/lib/rgm/rtreg). Resource Registration Configuring the High Availability Option for Sun 283 Configure Ingres High Availability Option After the Ingres High Availability Option package has been installed, perform these steps: 1. Become the super user on a cluster node by using the following command: % su 2. Create a failover resource group to hold the network and application resources by using the following command: # scrgadm –a –g < resource-group > [-h nodelist] where: -a Adds the data service resource type. -g Specifies the name of the resource group. This name can be of your choice but must be unique for the resource groups within the cluster. -h Specifies an optional comma-separated list of physical node names or IDs that identify potential masters. The order here determines the order in which the nodes are considered as primary during failover 3. Create a Logical Hostname resource in the group using the following command: # scrgadm –a –L –g < resource-group > -l <logical-hostname > where: -a Adds the data service resource type. -L Adds a logical Hostname resource type. -g Specifies the name of the resource group. This name can be your choice but must be unique for the resource groups with the cluster. -I Specifies a network resource. The network resource is the logical hostname or shared IP address that clients use to access Ingres for Sun Cluster HA Resource Registration 284 System Administrator Guide 4. Create an Ingres resource in the group by using the following Sun Cluster administration command: # scrgadm –a –j < resource-name > -g <resource-group > \\ -t Ingres.ingres_server \\ -x II_SYSTEM=< $II_SYSTEM > \\ –x II_OWNER=< ingres>"

To prevent other resources from being restarted along with the Ingres services, put them in a separate resource group.  To override the default values, you can set additional extension properties for the Ingres High Availability Option. 5. Bring the resource group online by using the following command: # scrgadm –Z -g <resource-group> -Z Enables all resources of the specified resource group. -g Specifies the name of the resource group. This name can be your choice but must be unique for resource groups within the cluster 6. Verify that the Ingres High Availability Option resource has come online on one node of the cluster by using the following command: # scstat -g Starting and Stopping Ingres in a Cluster Environment When using Ingres in a cluster environment, it must be started and stopped through the cluster service. If Ingres is shut down while under the control of the High Availability Option, the cluster service sees this as a failure and either tries to restart Ingres on the same node or fail over the service to the failover node. Clear a Fault in a Resource Group 286 System Administrator Guide Start Ingres in a Cluster Environment To bring Ingres online in a cluster environment, use the following Sun Cluster command: # scrgadm –Z –g <ingres_ resource_group > Note: Do not use the ingstart command to start Ingres in a cluster environment. Stop Ingres in a Cluster Environment To bring Ingres offline, use the following Sun Cluster command: # scrgadm –F –g < ingres_resource_group > Note: Do not use the ingstop command to stop Ingres in a cluster environment. Clear a Fault in a Resource Group If the resource group has a fault, Ingres cannot start. To clear the failure, use the following Sun Cluster command: # scswitch –c –h < host>–j <ingres_resource_name > –f STOP_FAILED To make sure Ingres is shutdown, use the command: # scrgadm –F –g <ingres_resource_group> Change a Resource Property To change a resource property, use the following command: # scrgadm –c –j < ingres_resource_name > –x <extension_property>=<value> Turn on Debugging and Tracing for the High Availability Option Configuring the High Availability Option for Sun 287 Turn on Debugging and Tracing for the High Availability Option To turn on debugging: 1.

Configuring the High Availability Option for Windows 289 Appendix B: Configuring the High Availability Option for Windows This appendix describes how to install and configure the Ingres High Availability Option in Windows cluster environments. The information in this appendix is intended for engineers with extensive knowledge of software and hardware in the cluster environment, including cluster concepts such as high availability (HA), cluster disk, resource types, virtual servers, cluster administrator, and failover. Note : This appendix assumes knowledge of Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server or Datacenter Server, Windows Clustering, and Windows 2000 Cluster Service. It refers to specific Windows Cluster Service commands and procedures. For additional information about these commands, see your Windows Cluster Service documentation. Failover Failover is the process by which a cluster automatically relocates a data service from a failed primary node to a designated secondary node. If a failover occurs, a brief interruption in service can occur, requiring you to reconnect after the failover has completed. Once reconnected, the physical server on which Ingres is running is transparent to the end user. The automatic failover feature ensures that transactions are handled by an active node in the cluster if a hardware or software failure occurs. Note: Any transactions that are in flight at the time of failure are lost. Ingres High Availability Option The Ingres High Availability Option for clusters runs application instances only on a single node. Depending on how the data service has been configured, when the fault monitor detects an error, it either attempts to restart the instance on the same node or to start the instance on another node for failover. Note: The Ingres High Availability Option is not scalable; that is, it does not provide active instances on multiple nodes. Configuration Guidelines for System and Data Files 290 System Administrator Guide Configuration Guidelines for System and Data Files Ingres system files, data, and related files must exist on a cluster disk. Cluster Disk A cluster disk is a disk on a shared bus connected to the cluster nodes, which all the cluster nodes can access (though not at the same time). Access to Ingres data does not depend on the type of cluster disk system (shared external SCSI, SCSI RAID, or SCSI over Fiber Channel). Physical Disk Resource Type The cluster service uses the Physical Disk resource type to manage disks that are on a cluster storage device. Disks must have the same drive letters on all cluster nodes. To prevent data corruption, only one node at a time can use a cluster disk. Cluster Service normally prevents more th an one node from using a disk at the same time. However, there are some circumstances not protected by ordinary cluster safeguards: when you install a new disk, and when you remove a disk from a cluster. For more information, see the Windows 2000 Server documentation. The Ingres system, data, and related files must exist on a Physical Disk resource type. Generic Service Resource Type You use the Generic Service resource to manage Windows 2000 services as cluster resources. The Ingres High Availability Option for Windows installs the Ingres Service as a Generic Service resource type. You must specify, during setup, the Physical Disk resources that contain the Ingres data and related files as dependencies"

The Ingres High Availability Option for Windows installs the Ingres Service as a Generic Service resource type. You must specify, during setup, the Physical Disk resources that contain the Ingres data and related files as dependencies of the Ingres Service cluster resource. DBMS Server Requirements Configuring the High Availability Option for Windows 291 DBMS Server Requirements When using the Ingres High Availability Option, the Ingres DBMS server is installed and configured as a typical installation, provided that the database-related files are installed on the cluster file system. At the time of installation, the installer checks if the database, checkpoint, journal, dump, work, and transaction log files are on cluster drives. For a clustered DBMS installation, the database, checkpoint, journal, dump, work, and transaction log files must be on a cluster drive. The II_SYSTEM (Ingres home directory) must be installed on a non-cluster local drive. This configuration should be done while at the Ingres DBMS Configuration screen during installation. Note: An error message is displayed if the installer finds that the database files are not on a cluster drive. Using a logical hostname simplifies the installation and configuration of the Ingres DBMS Server in the cluster environment. Conversely, each node can be independently configured. Virtual Servers To access a DBMS server in a non-cluster environment, network clients must connect to a physical server, identified by a network name and IP address. If that server fails, access to the DBMS is impossible. Windows 2000 Clustering enables the creati on of virtual servers, identified by a unique network name and IP address (different from the underlying physical server’s network name and IP address). Unlike a physical server, a virtual server is not associated with a specific computer. If the node hosting the virtual server fails, clients can still access the DBMS using the same server name. Virtual Server Name Installing the Ingres High Availability Option modifies the Ingres installation to use the virtual server name. This changes the config.dat file by replacing the server name with the virtual server name and sets II_HOSTNAME to the virtual server name. To automatically reconnect to the server after a failover, network clients must use this virtual server name when connecting to the DBMS Server. Windows Cluster Service Installation 292 System Administrator Guide Windows Cluster Service Installation The Windows Cluster Service must be installed and configured on the cluster nodes before installing the Ingres High Availability Option. The Cluster Service is a component of Windows Clustering that creates a server cluster and controls all aspects of its operation. Cluster Administrator Cluster Administrator is an application used to configure a cluster. It can run on any member of the trusted domain, whether the computer is a node of the cluster or not. Verify Windows Cluster Service Installation To verify the Windows Cluster Service installation, a system administrator can start Cluster Administrator from the Windows Start menu. Choose Start, Programs, Administrative Tools, Cluster Administrator. Cluster Command As an alternative to using Cluster Administrator to verify the Windows Cluster Service installation, you can use the cluster command from the Windows command prompt. Also, the command (cluster.exe) can be called from command scripts. To verify the installation, a system administrator can use the following commands: Command Description cluster /version Displays the cluster version and service pack information. cluster node Displays the status of all nodes in the cluster. cluster resource Displays the status of all cluster resources.

Starting and Stopping Ingres in a Cluster Environment 294 System Administrator Guide Functions Performed by the Ingres High Availability Option Setup Utility The Ingres High Availability Option setup utility performs the following functions:  Ensures that Ingres is installed as a service on the cluster node  Registers the Ingres Service as a Generic Service cluster resource  Creates or updates the cluster group for the DBMS Server or Communications Server (client-only)  Establishes dependencies of the Ingres Service on the required cluster resources (network name and disk)  Modifies the existing Ingres inst allation for Windows Clustering All administration must be done as a system administrator. Starting and Stopping Ingres in a Cluster Environment When using Ingres in a cluster environment, it must be started and stopped through the cluster service. If Ingres is shut down while under the control of the High Availability Option, the cluster service sees this as a failure and either tries to restart Ingres on the same node or fail over the service to the failover node.

Use this appendix as a reference in conjunction with the chapter “Setting Environment Variables and Logicals,” which describes the Ingres environment variables and logicals most commonly defined and the system level at which they are usually set. Additional special purpose Ingres environment variables and logicals can be used in your installation, depending on the equipment and configuration. DBNAME_ING DBNAME_ING specifies a startup file of set commands to be executed whenever a user opens the specified database ( DBNAME ) DBNAME _ING can be defined installation-wide or locally. Windows: DBNAME_ING affects any user who connects to the database specified by DBNAME using the QUEL Terminal Monitor. UNIX: DBNAME_ING is effective in all user interfaces, including a terminal monitor. VMS: The syntax for defining this logical is: define DBNAME_ING path_to_file DBNAME_SQL_INIT DBNAME_SQL_INIT specifies a startup file of set commands to be executed whenever a user connects to the database specified by DBNAME using the SQL single-line Terminal Monitor. It can be set installation-wide or locally. For details on using DBNAME_SQL_INIT, see the chapter “Setting Environment Variables and Logicals.” DD_RSERVERS 300 System Administrator Guide DD_RSERVERS DD_RSERVERS points to the directory hierarchy that is used by the Replicator servers. Note: DD_RSERVERS is not a required variable. If it is not set, it defaults to the \"rep\" subdirectory under the Ingres installation directory. Windows: By default, DD_RSERVERS is defined to be %II_SYSTEM%\\ingres\\rep. To define a di fferent location, use, for example: set DD_RSERVERS c:\\rep2 UNIX: By default, DD_RSERVERS is defined to be the $II_SYSTEM/ingres/rep. To define a different loca tion, use, for example: C Shell: setenv DD_SERVERS /usr/rep2 Bourne Shell: DD_RSERVERS=/usr/rep2; export DD_RSERVERS VMS: By default, DD_RSERVERS is defined to be the II_SYSTEM:[ingres.rep]. To define a different loca tion, use, for example: define DD_RSERVERS user_disk:[rep2] The $DD_RSERVERS/servers (DD_SERVERS:[servers] for VMS) directory contains server1 through server10. These directories are used by the Replicator servers during runtime. If you need your installation to support multiple Replicator configurations and/or multiple source databases, use DD_RSERVERS to access each Replicator environment. For each environment, create a DD_RSERVERS directory with the subdirectory servers. In the servers directory, create subdirectories server1 through server N where N is the number assigned to the Replicator Server. II_4GL_DECIMAL II_4GL_DECIMAL determines the decimal point character for 4GL source input. For example, in France, the decimal point character is a comma. The default value is “.”. Valid values are “.” and “,”. II_AFD_TIMEOUT Environment Variables and Logicals 301 II_AFD_TIMEOUT II_AFD_TIMEOUT is used to set the number of seconds before timeout in Vision’s Application Flow Diagram. When you are using Vision’s Application Flow Diagram, Vision periodically checks for changes made by concurrent de velopers that affect the diagram. If such a change has been made, Vision notifies you and gives you a chance to update the display. You can set II_AFD_TIMEOUT to any value greater than 20, or 0 to disable the timeouts. Setting the value to much less than the default of 300 seconds causes Vision to time out and query the database often enough to visibly affect performance. II_APPLICATION_LANGUAGE II_APPLICATION_LANGUAGE is set to the language Application-By-Forms uses to translate string constants. ABF allows you to internationalize your applications by translating the string constants you define for them. When you run the application, it normally uses the constants defined for your default language. You can override this by defining II_APPLICATION_LANGUAGE to the name of another language.

For more information, see Forms- based Application Development Tools User Guide . II_BIND_SVC_xx II_BIND_SVC_xx is set to the bind address for Ingres tools connections to a named Ingres or Enterprise Access installation. II_C_COMPILER (VMS) II_C_COMPILER is set to the value of the C compiler in use for ABF. Valid entries are VAX11(VAX/VMS only), DECC, or NONE. II_C_COMPILER is defined at the system or group level. (Call technical support for information about how to change the C compiler used by ABF). II_CHARSETxx 302 System Administrator Guide II_CHARSETxx II_CHARSETxx is used to set the type of character set used for string operations. This is set during ingbuild and cannot be changed without corrupting data. II_CHECKPOINT II_CHECKPOINT is an area set to the fu ll file specification for the default checkpoint location. It is set by the system administrator during the ingbuild procedure and cannot be changed, even during installation updates. Specific databases can designate alternate locations for checkpoints as a parameter to the createdb command. II_CLIENT II_CLIENT is set to “true” for client installations. Do not change II_CLIENT if it is set. II_COLLATION II_COLLATION determines the collating sequence for a database when the database is created. Valid entries are “multi” to specify the DEC Multinational Character Sequence or “spanish” to specify the Spanish alphabet’s character sequence. More on collation sequences is described in Local Collation Sequences (see page 94). II_COLLATION can be define d at the system level or redefined by the individual user at the process or job level. II_CONFIG II_CONFIG sets the full file specification of the Ingres files directory during the installation procedure. It cannot be changed. II_CONNECT_RETRIES II_CONNECT_RETRIES sets the number of times an application retries a connection before returning an error. The de fault is 1. An optional flag (d or D) causes a delay before the retry. For example: II_CONNECT_RETRIES=1d. II_DATABASE Environment Variables and Logicals 303 II_DATABASE II_DATABASE is an area set to the fu ll file specification for the default database location. It is set by the system administrator during the ingbuild procedure and cannot be changed, even during installation updates. Specific databases can designate alternate locations as a parameter to the createdb command. II_DATE_FORMAT II_DATE_FORMAT defines the format styl e for date values. It is defined installation-wide. Default is the US value with an output format of dd-mmm- yyyy. Default legal input formats for US dates include: mm/dd/yy mm/dd/yyyy dd-mmm-yyyy mm-dd-yyyy yyyy.mm.dd yyyy_mm_dd mmddyy mm-dd mm/dd If set, it replaces the default format with an alternative format. The following are valid II_DATE_FORMAT settings, show ing the alternative output format: Setting Output Format US (default) dd-mm-yy ISO yymmdd MULTINATIONAL dd/mm/yy SWEDEN or FINLAND yyyy-mm-dd GERMAN dd.mm.yy DMY dd-mmm-yyyy MDY mmmm-dd-yyyy YMD yyyy-mmm-dd II_DATE_CENTURY_ BOUNDARY 304 System Administrator Guide For example, if the logical’s setting is ISO, the dates are output as yymmdd . If you enter a date using a similar, six-character format, such as mmddyy , the date is interpreted on output as yymmdd . For example, if you enter the date March 9, 1912, as 030912 ( mmddyy ) and II_DATE_FORMAT is set to ISO, this date is interpreted as Sept. 12, 1903 (030912 as yymmdd ). You receive an error message if the date you entered cannot be interpreted as a valid date in the output format. Note : When using the _date4() function (MULTINATIONAL4), the output format for the year value always returns ‘ yyyy’. For more information about valid date input and output formats, see the SQL Reference Guide . II_DATE_CENTURY_ BOUNDARY II_DATE_CENTURY_BOUNDARY determines the inferred century for a date that is missing the century on input. It can be set to an integer value in the range of 0 < n < =100. If this environment variable is not set in the user’s environment or if it is set to 0 or 100, the current century is used. The century is determined by the following calculation: if ( date_year < II_DATE_CENTURY_BOUNDARY ) then (date_year += 2000) else (date_year += 1900) endif For example, if II_DATE_CENTURY_BOUNDARY is 50 and the current year is 1999, an input date of 3/17/51 is treated as March 17, 1951, but a date of 03/17/49 is treated as March 17, 2049.

II_DBMS_LOG Environment Variables and Logicals 305 II_DBMS_LOG II_DBMS_LOG points to the location of the log file containing DBMS server- specific error messages. It is set installation-wide. The server reads it at startup time, so changing it after startup has no effect on an existing server. Most error messages written to this file are also logged to the installation-wide error log (errlog.log). Some server trace messages and statistics information are written to the II_DBMS_LOG file that are not written to errlog.log. The default, if not set, is $II_SY STEM/ingres/files/errlog.log. II_DBMS_SERVER II_DBMS_SERVER points to the DBMS Se rver to which the client process automatically connects. It can be set installation-wide or locally. When II_DBMS_SERVER is set, application pr ocesses bypass the Name Server. Using II_DBMS_SERVER requires setting II_GC_REMOTE (see page 308) in the DBMS Server installation. II_DECIMAL II_DECIMAL specifies the one character used to separate fractional and non-fractional parts of a number. Default va lue is the period (.), as in 12.34. Alternatively, the comma (,) can be used, as in 12,34. Only (.) and (,) are allowed. It is set installation-wide. II_DIRECT_IO (UNIX) II_DIRECT_IO is specific to UNIX environm ent. If set, it causes disk reads and writes to be done directly to disk, circumventing the UNIX file buffer system. It is only available on some platforms. II_DISABLE_SYSCHECK II_DISABLE_SYSCHECK controls the execution of the syscheck command. The syscheck command checks the system to confirm the availability of the required resources for running Ingr es. If II_DISABLE_SYSCHECK is set, syscheck is still called but will immediately exit without performing any checks and with a success return status. For more information on the syscheck command, see Command Reference Guide . II_DML_DEF 306 System Administrator Guide II_DML_DEF II_DML_DEF defines the default query lang uage for an installation as SQL or QUEL. It is used in installations that support both the SQL and QUEL database languages, in which case one such language can be designated as the default. Applications-By-Forms, Ingres 4GL, and Report-By-Forms are parts of the Ingres tools that use II_DML_DEF. SQL is the default if this is not set. It can be set installation-wide or locally. II_DUMP II_DUMP defines an “area” that specifie s the default location of the dump log files used in online backup. (For more information on online backup, see the ckpdb description in the Command Reference Guide .) It is defined installation- wide in the ingbuild procedure and cannot be changed. II_EMBED_SET II_EMBED_SET allows application programs to set a variety of features. It can be set installation-wide or locally. The acceptable values and the actions they specify are: errorqry Prints query that caused error. savequery Enables/disables saving of the text of the last query issued. Specify 1 to enable or 0 to disable. To obtain the text of the last query, you must issue the inquire_ingres(: query = querytext) statement. To determine whether saving is enabled, use the inquire_ingres(: status =savequery) statement. printqry Prints all query text and timing information to iiprtqry.log file in the current directory. qryfile Specifies an alternate text file to which query information is written. The default file name is iiprtqry.log. printgca Traces GCA messages to the iiprtgca.log file in the current directory. II_ERSEND (UNIX) Environment Variables and Logicals 307 gcafile Specifies an alternate text file to which GCA information is written. The default file name is iiprtgca.log. printtrace Enables or disables saving of DBMS trace messages to a text file (specified by tracefile). Specify 1 to enable saving of trace output, or 0 to disable saving. tracefile Specifies an alternate text file to which tracepoint information is written. The default file name is iiprttrc.log. sqlprint Prints all errors and database procedure messages arising from embedded SQL statement. eventdisplay Print events as they return from DBMS. dbmserror Makes local (DBMS) error numbers the default error numbers returned to the application in errorno and the SQLCA’s sqlcode. genericerror Makes generic error numbers the default error numbers returned to the application in errorno and the SQLCA’s sqlcode. prefetchrows Specifies the number of rows to be “prefetched” when retrieving data using cursors."

Valid arguments are: 0 (default) Ingres determines the number of rows to prefetch. 1 Disables prefetching. Each row is fetched individually. N (positive integer) Specifies the number of rows to be prefetched. II_ERSEND (UNIX) II_ERSEND is set during the installation procedure to the full path name of the errlog.log file. II_FORCE_HET 308 System Administrator Guide II_FORCE_HET II_FORCE_HET must be set to TRUE to allow seamless communication between the local client and remote databases on 64-bit HP Tru64 Alpha (formerly DEC Alpha) systems. II_FORCE_ HET must be set before the client program attempts communication. For the change to take effect, the Communication Server and Name Server must be stopped and restarted. II_FRS_KEYFIND II_FRS_KEYFIND allows users to turn off the keyfind frs function on table fields in read mode. II_GC_REMOTE II_GC_REMOTE allows or disallows a direct connection between the application process on the client machine and the Ingres DBMS process on the server machine, thus bypassing Name Server processing. The vnode attribute, connection_type, must be set to “direc t” to enable direct connections. For additional information on this vnode attribute, see the Connectivity Guide . II_GC_REMOTE only needs to be set in the DBMS Server installation. Valid II_GC_REMOTE values are: ON or ENABLE On or Enable allows direct connections that use the vnode attribute as described above, and rejects direct connections that are attempted using the II_DBMS_SERVER environment variable. FULL or ALL Full or All allows both vnode controlled and II_DBMS_SERVER controlled direct connections. You must avoid using this setting because it compromises network security. (No validation occurs to determine whether the client installation has permission to access the server installation.) If II_GC_REMOTE is not set, or is not set to one of the above values, direct connections are disallowed. II_GCA_LOG II_GCA_LOG denotes the output destination for II_GC x_TRACE trace information for all Ingres components. Can be set to stdio or to the full path to a file. II_GCx_TRACE Environment Variables and Logicals 309 II_GCx_TRACE II_GCx_TRACE specifies environment variables and logicals for tracing: II_GCA_TRACE Sets the trace level for General Communications Architecture (GCA) II_GCN_TRACE Sets the trace level for Name Server (GCN) II_GCC_TRACE Sets the trace level for Communication Server (GCC) II_GCD_TRACE Sets the trace level for Data Access Server (GCD) II_GC_TRACE Sets the trace level for GCA Compatibility Library II_GCCCL_TRACE Sets the trace level for GCC Compatibility Library Each variable can be set separately to a number from 0 to 4 specifying trace level, with levels 1 through 4 increasing in amount of information traced. If any of these values are set to non-zero, trace statements for the appropriate items are logged in the II_GCA_LOG file. II_GCC_LOG II_GCC_LOG denotes the output destination for the Communications Server (GCC) trace information. Setting this environment variable is preferable to using II_GCA_LOG because it is dedicated to the Communications Server process. II_GCD_LOG II_GCD_LOG denotes the output destination for the Data Access Server (GCD) trace information. Setting this environment variable is preferable to using II_GCA_LOG because it is dedicated to the Data Access Server process. II_GCN_LOG 310 System Administrator Guide II_GCN_LOG II_GCN_LOG denotes the output destination for the Name Server (GCN) trace information. Setting this environment variable is preferable to using II_GCA_LOG because it is dedicated to the Name Server process. II_GCNxx_PORT II_GCNxx_PORT contains the connect address of a local installation’s Name Server. This variable must not be reset. xx = 2-character code defined by II_INSTALLATION II_HALF_DUPLEX II_HALF_DUPLEX, if set to 0 or undefined, enables Net duplex operation for SNA LU6.2 conversations. If set to 1, the Net half-duplex operation is enabled. II_HELP_EDIT II_HELP_EDIT, if set to any value, adds an extra operation, Edit, to menus encountered in help text screens in the forms systems. The Edit operation enables users to edit the help text in the screen with the text editor defined by ING_EDIT. II_HELP_EDIT is typically de fined locally by the individual user. II_INSTALLATION II_INSTALLATION is a two-character code used to define a particular installation. This code is set during installation. If you want to change it, rerun ingbuild.

The system administrator during the ingbuild procedure sets it and it cannot be changed, even during installation updates. Specific databases can designate alternate locations for journals as a parameter to the createdb command. II_LANGUAGE Environment Variables and Logicals 311 II_LANGUAGE II_LANGUAGE determines what language is used for screen messages, menu items, and prompts. It is defined installa tion-wide. Valid values are as follows: ENGLISH English (Default) DEU German ESN Spanish FRA French ITA Italian JPN Japanese PTB Brazilian Portuguese SCH Simplified Chinese II_LOG_DEVICE (VMS) II_LOG_DEVICE specifies the name of the logging/locking pseudo device to which the logging/locking driver is connected. This value is QAA0: for production installations. For test installations, the value is Q xA0:, where x is the first character of the group installation identifier. This logical is defined at the system or group level. II_MONEY_FORMAT II_MONEY_FORMAT defines the format of money output. It is set installation- wide. You can change the format by setting II_MONEY_FORMAT to a string with two symbols separated by a colon (:). The symbol to the left of the colon indicates the location of the currency symbol. It must be “L” for a leading currency symbol or a “T” for a trailing currency symbol. The symbol to the right of the colon is the currency symbol you want displayed. Currency symbols can contain up to 4 physical characters. For example: Logical Definition Result L:$ $100 T:DM 100DM T:F 100F II_MONEY_PREC 312 System Administrator Guide II_MONEY_PREC II_MONEY_PREC specifies the number of decimal places to be displayed for money values. Valid values are 0, 1, and 2. The default is 2 (for decimal currency). It is set installation-wide. II_MONEY_PREC is applied when a money value is converted to a character string (for printing, for example). Extra decimal places are rounded. For example, if II_MONEY_PREC is set to 0, 9.50 is rounded to 10. II_MSGDIR II_MSGDIR sets the directory containing error and information messages. Users must not change this setting. The default file is the II_LANGUAGE setting, located at $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/english. II_NULL_STRING II_NULL_STRING specifies the string used by a terminal monitor and other Ingres tools to represent the null value. The string consists of one to three characters. The default value is three blanks. II_NUM_OF_PROCESSORS II_NUM_OF_PROCESSORS is set to the number of processors on the machine. The variable affects processing in the Ingres DBMS, particularly when waiting for mutually exclusive resources; a value larger than 1 causes a more compute-intensive strategy that may result in getting the resource faster; however, this strategy is not generally advisable on single processor machines. II_NUM_SLAVES (UNIX) Environment Variables and Logicals 313 II_NUM_SLAVES (UNIX) II_NUM_SLAVES specifies the number of slave processes that a DBMS server creates to do disk operations. The default is two, but systems having applications with high I/O throughput requirements, many disks, or faster disk drives can increase the number of slave processes. The following example allows each new server that is started to have four slaves: ingsetenv II_NUM_SLAVES 4 Stop and restart DBMS servers to re set the number of slaves. The maximum supported value is 30 and the minimum is 0. Setting this environment variable/logical to 0 degrades performance substantially. Note: On UNIX implementations that use O/S threads, II_NUM_SLAVES is not set and there are no I/O slaves. II_OO_TABLE_SIZE II_OO_TABLE_SIZE allows you to increase the size of an internal COPYAPP table to support the copying of more app lication objects than is allowed by the default (4096 objects). II_PATTERN_MATCH II_PATTERN_MATCH determines the set of pattern matching characters for QBF and the ABF qualification function. These can be SQL-like, QUEL-like, or not set. sql The pattern matching characters used by QBF and the ABF qualification function are % _ [ and ]. The % is equivalent to the QUEL“*” and _ is equivalent to the QUEL “?”. quel The pattern matching characters used by QBF and the ABF qualification function are * ? [ and ]. <not set> If not set, or if it is set to anything other than sql or quel, the QUEL pattern matching characters are used. II_PATTERN_MATCH can be set installation-wide or locally. The complete word, either sql or quel, must be entered. The setting for II_PATTERN_MATCH is case-sensitive.

II_PF_NODE 314 System Administrator Guide II_PF_NODE II_PF_NODE specifies the vnode name of a remote node to be managed through the Microsoft Windows Performance Monitor. II_POST_4GLGEN II_POST_4GLGEN specifies a command to be translated and executed by the Vision component following successful generation of Ingres 4GL code. The command is passed the full path name of the Ingres 4GL source file just generated. This logical is used only by sites that have installed the Vision product. For more information on this logical, see the Forms-based Application Development Tools User Guide . II_PRINTSCREEN _FILE II_PRINTSCREEN_FILE is used with the printscreen function. It specifies a default file name for the output file of the printscreen function. This environment variable/logical is usually defined locally by the individual user. If this environment variable/logical is se t and no file name is sent to the printscreen function, no prompt is given and this file name is used. If not set, the user is prompted for a file name. If the file name “printer” is specified for II_PRINTSCREEN_FILE, the screen depiction is sent directly to the line printer. For more information, see the Character-based Querying and Reporting Tools User Guide . II_SQL_INIT II_SQL_INIT (see page 76) can be set locally to the full path name of a file containing SQL commands. Typically, it is defined locally by the individual user. When a user with II_SQL_INIT set connects to a terminal monitor, the commands in the named file are processed. II_STAR_LOG II_STAR_LOG points to the location of the log file containing distributed DBMS server-specific error messages. It is set installation-wide. It is read by the server at startup time, so changing it after startup has no effect on an existing server. Most error messages written to this file are also logged to the installation-wide error log (errlog.log). Some server trace messages and statistics information are written to the II_STAR_LOG file that are not written to errlog.log. The default, if not set, is $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/errlog.log. II_SYSTEM Environment Variables and Logicals 315 II_SYSTEM II_SYSTEM specifies an “area” that specifies the parent directory of the ingres directory, where many components of your installation are located. It must not be changed without reinstalling Ingres. II_TEMPORARY II_TEMPORARY specifies the directory where temporary files used by the Ingres tools are created. By default, these files are created in the user’s current directory. II_TEMPORARY can be re defined installation-wide or locally. II_TERMCAP_FILE II_TERMCAP_FILE specifies an alternative te rmcap file to use. This file must be in Ingres termcap file format. It can be redefined installation-wide or locally. II_TFDIR II_TFDIR specifies the directory in which the Vision code generator searches for Ingres 4GL template files. This logica l is used only by sites that have the Vision component installed. II_THREAD_TYPE II_THREAD_TYPE specifies whether Ingres uses internal threads or OS threads. Valid settings are: OS (default) Operating System threads INTERNAL Internal threads This variable can be set during installation. For additional information on setting this variable for your platform, see the Readme file. II_TIMEZONE_NAME 316 System Administrator Guide II_TIMEZONE_NAME II_TIMEZONE_NAME specifies the world time zone that determines the installation’s location for timing purposes. It is defined during the ingbuild procedure. II_TM_ON_ERROR II_TM_ON_ERROR defines the action taken when an error occurs in a terminal monitor. The valid settings are continue (on error) or terminate (on error). If this environment variable/logical is not set, the default action for the (non-forms based) terminal monitor is to continue; the default for Interactive SQL or QUEL (the forms-based terminal monito r) is to terminate. It can be defined installation-wide or locally by the individual user. II_TUXEDO_LOC II_TUXEDO_LOC supports Ingres DTP for Tuxedo. Specifies the directory where the shared memory file is to be created. It must be the same for all servers in a group. If II_TUXEDO_LOC is not set, II_TEMPORARY is used. II_TUX_SHARED If II_TUX_SHARED is set to USER, the name of the shared memory segment used by Ingres is t<username>.tu x; otherwise the name is t1.tux. II_TUX_AS_MAX II_TUX_AS_MAX is the maximum number of application and TMS servers that can be started. The default value is 32. A maximum of II_TUX_AS_MAX servers are permitted to attach to the Ingres shared memory segment. II_TUX_XN_MAX II_TUX_XN_MAX is the total number of transaction entries allocated in the shared memory segment. Each server that attaches the shared memory segment reserves II_XA_SESSION_CACHE_LIMIT transaction entries for its own use. The default value is 1024. II_UNICODE_CONVERTER Environment"

Each server that attaches the shared memory segment reserves II_XA_SESSION_CACHE_LIMIT transaction entries for its own use. The default value is 1024. II_UNICODE_CONVERTER Environment Variables and Logicals 317 II_UNICODE_CONVERTER II_UNICODE_CONVERTER sets the converter to be used for Unicode coercion. The DBMS Server carries out the coercion of Unicode data to local character set value based on the Unicode converter (or mapping table). Several converters are available in compiled and xml format, located in the directory $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/ucha rmaps. By default, Ingres automatically chooses the converter to use, based on the encoding used by the locale on your system. You can manually set II_UNICODE_CONVERTER if Ingres is unable to set the converter correctly for your locale for coercing Unicode data to local character set value. To manually set II_UNICODE_CONVER TER on UNIX based on locale 1. Type the following at the UNIX command prompt: locale The locale on your system is returned. 2. Use the locale value to find the character set on your system. For example, if locale is ja_JP.sjis, issue the following command: LC_CTYPE=ja_JP.sjis locale charmap The character set used by the system is returned. 3. Look up the character set in the file $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/ucharmaps/charmapalias.xml. This file lists mapping IDs and their corresponding aliases. Find the mapping ID by finding the alias name value that matches the alias name. This mapping ID is the value of the converter. 4. Set the value of II_UNICODE_CONVERTER in the symbol table, as follows: ingsetenv II_UNICODE_CONVERTER mapping_id Recycle the server by issuing the ingstop and the ingstart commands. II_UUID_MAC (Windows) II_UUID_MAC, when set to TRUE, uses an older algorithm for generating UUIDs on Windows. For security reasons, the uuid_create function on Windows no longer uses a machine's MAC address to generate UUIDs. You can use the II_UUID_MAC environment variable if you do not need the level of security provided by the new uuid_create algorithm and for the sake of compatibility want to continue to use the MAC address of your machine when creating UUIDs. II_VNODE_PATH 318 System Administrator Guide II_VNODE_PATH II_VNODE_PATH specifies a series of remote virtual nodes to be tried each time a user attempts to connect to the specified vnode . Node names are specified as strings to be appended to vnode. Commas must separate the strings. For example, the following specifies that the remote virtual nodes mynode0, mynode1, mynode2, and mynode3 be tried each time a user attempts to connect to mynode: II_MYNODE_PATH=0, 1, 2, 3 The names must be valid remote virtual nodes defined by the Ingres Network Utility or the Net Management Utility (netutil). A single connection attempt begins with one of the nodes, chosen at random, and continues until all of the specified nodes have been tried. The number of connection attempts made before an error is returned to the user is determined by the value of II_CONNECT_RETRIES. II_WORK II_WORK specifies a directory that contains temporary files used by Ingres during the execution of certain queries such as sorts, copies, and modifies. II_XA_TRACE_FILE II_XA_TRACE_FILE specifies a file in which Ingres DTP (Distributed Transaction Processing) logs the events occurring through the TMXA interface, as well as any SQL performed against the Ingres DBMS. The user who starts the application servers must have write access to the file. For additional information about this file, see the Distributed Transaction Processing User Guide . IIDLDIR IIDLDIR specifies a directory that contains dynamically loaded libraries. ING_ABFDIR Environment Variables and Logicals 319 ING_ABFDIR ING_ABFDIR defines the directory name for the top-level directory to contain Application-By-Forms object libraries and work files . Under this directory, a subdirectory is created for each database that contains ABF applications and, within that subdirectory, another subdirectory is created for each ABF application . The ING_ABFDIR directory level must have read, write, and execute permissions for group, owner, and world . If, however, the application designer redefines ING_ABFDIR to poin t to a directory of his own, he can optionally restrict permissions on the directory to read, write, execute to owner . It can be redefined installation-wide or locally. ING_ABFOPT1 ING_ABFOPT1 specifies the name of a file, used by ABF, in which additional linker options can be placed . These options are not required to run ABF applications but can be required to include libraries, compiled objects, and other capabilities not available in ABF . Users can modify this file .

For more information, see the Forms-based Application Development Tools User Guide . The individual user usually defines it at the local level. ING_EDIT 320 System Administrator Guide ING_EDIT ING_EDIT specifies the default editor invoked by various editor commands . The default for the entire installation is set during the installation procedure . Users can also set this in their local environment. Windows: You must set ING_EDIT to the full path name of the editor . For example: c:\\tools\\vi.exe UNIX: /usr/ucb/vi VMS: If undefined, the callable EDT editor is called . ING_EDIT can be defined to be: +EDT Call the EDT editor +TPU Call the TPU editor +LSE Call the language sensitive editor. The “+” symbol indicates that the callable version of the editor is to be used . This avoids creating a new subprocess in which to run the editor and results in much faster start up of the editor when called from a terminal monitor, ABF and other Ingres tools programs . Example: DEFINE ING_EDIT \"+TPU\" No qualifiers can be used . You must specify any non-default editor behavior in an editor startup file . For example, to use the Language Sensitive Editor in FORTRAN, define the following: DEFINE ING_EDIT \"+LSE\" DEFINE LSE$COMMAND - \"SYS$LOGIN:LSE_STARTUP.LSE\" ING_PRINT ING_PRINT specifies the default printer command issued by the Print function . The default is PRINT . It is usually defined locally by the individual user. ING_SET Environment Variables and Logicals 321 ING_SET ING_SET specifies a quoted string or startup file of set commands to be executed whenever a user connects to the DBMS Server through an application, an Ingres tool, or a single-line terminal monitor . It can be set installation-wide or locally . For details on using ING_SET, see the chapter “Setting Environment Variables and Logicals.” ING_SET_DBNAME ING_SET_DBNAME specifies a quoted string or startup file of set commands to be executed whenever a user connects to the database specified by DBNAME. Affects any user who connects to the specified database through an application, an Ingres tool, or a single-line terminal monitor . It can be set installation-wide or locally . For details on using ING_SET_ DBNAME , see the chapter “Setting Environment Variables and Logicals.” ING_SHELL (UNIX) ING_SHELL, If defined, contains the pa th name of the shell used by Ingres Menu and a terminal monitor when the shell operation is invoked. ING_SYSTEM_SET ING_SYSTEM_SET specifies a quoted string or startup file of set commands to be executed whenever a user connects to the DBMS Server through an application, an Ingres tool, or a terminal monitor. It is always global. For details on using ING_SYSTEM_SET, see the chapter “Setting Environment Variables and Logicals.” INGRES_KEYS INGRES_KEYS specifies a mapping file to customize a user’s keyboard layout for use with forms based programs. For a complete description of the mapping file syntax, see Character-based Querying and Reporting Tools User Guide . This environment variable/logical is usually set in the user’s local environment. INIT_INGRES 322 System Administrator Guide INIT_INGRES INIT_INGRES can be set to the full file specification of a file containing QUEL commands . It is usually defined locally by the individual user . When a user with INIT_INGRES set connects to the QUEL Terminal Monitor, the commands in the named file are processed . For details on using INIT_INGRES, see the chapter “Setting Environment Variables and Logicals.” TERM (UNIX) TERM is the terminal description for the terminal upon which you are executing UNIX programs . The TERM environment variable is not used directly, but it becomes the default for TERM_INGRES, if TERM_INGRES is not explicitly set. TERM is used by UNIX programs like vi, which can be called as subsystems from Ingres programs. TERM_INGRES TERM_INGRES contains the terminal designation for the terminal upon which you are executing one of the Ingres forms-based products, such as QBF or VIFRED. For a list of supported values, see Character-based Querying and Reporting Tools User Guide . It is usually defined locally by the individual user.
